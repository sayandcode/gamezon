It was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in November 2019 and worldwide in September 2020, with a Nintendo Switch version released in April 2022. The game is divided between side-scrolling adventure segments and real-time strategy (RTS) battles, and follows thirteen high-school students in a fictionalized 1980s Japan who are dragged into a futuristic war between mechas and hostile Kaiju in a nonlinear narrative.\nDirector and writer George Kamitani conceived the game in 2013 following the completion of Dragon's Crown, originally pitching it for a toy line. 13 Sentinels began production two years later, discarding the toy line element under Atlus. The production proved challenging for Vanillaware, as the studio dealt with workload and development challenges. Contrary to previous works, Kamitani both worked on the script alone and handed character design duties to Yukiko Hirai and Emika Kida. Hitoshi Sakimoto and his studio Basiscape, who handled the music for Vanillaware's past games, revisited their roles.\nOriginally scheduled for a 2018 release on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, the game was delayed to 2019 with the Vita version being canceled. The English localization by Atlus West proved challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It saw a slow start in sales upon its release in Japan before eventually exceeding Atlus's expectations, going on to sell over 500,000 copies worldwide by November 2021.

The story follows best-selling thriller novelist Alan Wake as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life.\nIn its pacing and structure, Alan Wake is similar to a thriller television series, with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers. The game itself consists of six episodes, and the storyline is continued by two special episodes, titled \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\", that were made available as downloadable content (DLC) within the same year of the game's release. Together, they make the first season of a possibly longer story. Additionally, a six-episode live-action web series called Bright Falls acts as a prequel to the game, and a number of related books also expand upon the Alan Wake story. Alan Wake Remastered, featuring the full game and both DLC episodes and published by Epic Games Publishing, was released on Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in October 2021. Remedy would then announce a port of Remastered for the Nintendo Switch with a release window of Fall 2022.\nChiefly written by Sam Lake, Alan Wake took over five years to create. The game was originally developed as an open-world survival game as an anti-thesis to Remedy's prior linear Max Payne games, but struggled over three years in merging the gameplay with the action-thriller story they wanted to tell. After an intense two-month period, the team reworked the game to be a more traditional linear game broken into an episodic approach but which better supported the planned narrative structure and capable of reusing much of the open world assets already built.\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, has garnered a cult following, and is often praised for its visuals, sound, narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. Alan Wake was awarded the first spot in Time magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. Alan Wake's American Nightmare, a stand-alone spin-off/follow-up, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled. However, the scrapped sequel became the foundation and inspiration of Remedy's next title, Quantum Break. Later, Remedy released Control in 2019 which contained references to Alan Wake. Remedy has said that Alan Wake and Control form part of their Remedy connected universe that will serve as a basis for future games. Alan Wake II was announced at The Game Awards 2021  in December and is planned for release in 2023.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Oct 5, 2021","price":"$28.98","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Alan-Wake-Remastered-PlayStation-4/dp/B09GWNP6SH"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Alan Wake Remastered","price":"$28.79","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Alan-Wake-Remastered-Xbox-X/dp/B09GWPZGNB"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF_YGL3W6CE"},"Alba: A Wildlife Adventure":{"Title":"Alba: A Wildlife Adventure","Genre(s)":"Adventure","Developer(s)":"Ustwo","Publisher(s)":"Ustwo","Description":"Alba: A Wildlife Adventure is an open world adventure game developed by Ustwo Games.

Players can choose one of three character classes, each with its own abilities. Players can upgrade their weapons with collectables, known as upgrade cores.\nThe development of Alienation was hinted at in early January 2014 and announced at the 2014 Sony Gamescom convention. In 2015, the developers released details of the gameplay and classes and its first trailer. According to Sony, the game would be released sometime in 2015; it was delayed until March 2, 2016. After another three-week delay, it was released as part of a Sony promotion releasing six games in seven weeks. Since the release of Alienation, Housemarque has updated the game with free and paid expansions. It received positive reviews, with praise for the twin-stick elements and cooperative multiplayer feature.

Based on the Alien film series, the game is set 15 years after the events of the original 1979 film Alien, and follows engineer Amanda Ripley, daughter of Alien protagonist Ellen Ripley, as she investigates the disappearance of her mother aboard the space station Sevastopol. Once inside, Amanda discovers that the station has fallen into disarray due to an Alien creature on the loose and must find a way to escape. The game emphasizes stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid, outsmart, and fight enemies with tools such as a motion tracker and flamethrower.\nAlien: Isolation was designed to resemble the original Alien film rather than its more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future could look like. It runs on an engine built to accommodate the Alien's behaviour and technical aspects such as atmospheric and lighting effects. Creative Assembly intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but used first-person to create a more intense experience. Several downloadable content packs were released, some of which relive scenes from the original film.\nAlien: Isolation received positive reviews and sold over two million copies by May 2015. Its retro-futuristic art direction, sound design, and artificial intelligence were praised, while its characters and length received some criticism. It appeared in multiple \"best of\" lists and won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards.

The series centers on Rolfe's titular skit character, often simply shortened to \"the Nerd\" (sometimes just \"Nerd\"), a short-tempered and foul-mouthed gamer who delivers commentary on retro games of poor quality. While the series began with Rolfe simply playing games while delivering a running commentary, the show would eventually grow in scope to encompass sketches featuring guest characters, reviews of gaming consoles and peripherals, and short lectures about video game history and culture.Starting out as an independent filmmaker, Rolfe intended for his earliest videos of the character who was originally called The Angry Nintendo Nerd to be a joke privately shown to his friends. In 2004, Rolfe, by suggestion from longtime friend Mike Matei, put the Angry Nintendo Nerd videos on his website, and in 2006 on the emerging video streaming platform YouTube, where it gained popularity. From there, the series became a cult success, and Rolfe began appearing as the character in various other media such as a feature-length film and video games, and many public appearances. The series was soon renamed The Angry Video Game Nerd to avoid trademark issues with Nintendo, and to allow Rolfe to review games from non-Nintendo consoles. From 2007 to 2011, the series was also released on ScrewAttack and GameTrailers.\nThe Angry Video Game Nerd is considered one of the pioneers of internet review videos, being highly influential on the style and format of subsequent video reviewers as well as being responsible for helping to bring the concept into the mainstream. Various similar review/sketch comedy entertainers have since cited the show as inspiration for their own material, such as JonTron, Nostalgia Critic, Egoraptor, Angry Joe, and Joueur du Grenier among others.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"TBA","price":"$14.99","purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001179"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/AngryNintendoNerd"},"Anima: Gate of Memories":{"Title":"Anima: Gate of Memories","Genre(s)":"Action role-playing","Developer(s)":"Anima Project","Publisher(s)":"BadLand Games","Description":"Anima: Gate of Memories is an action role-playing video game developed by the independent game studio Anima Project and published by Badland Indie.

Chahi developed his own game engine, completing all the game's art and animations in vector form to reduce memory use, with some use of rotoscoping to help plan out character movements. Both narratively and gameplay-wise, he wanted the game to be told with little to no language or user-interface elements. The game was originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST but has since been widely ported to other contemporary systems, including home and portable consoles and mobile devices. Chahi has since overseen release of various anniversary releases of the game.\nAnother World was innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which earned the game praise among critics and commercial success.

It is the fifth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2011's Assassin's Creed: Revelations. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release in November 2012. A remastered version of the game was released in 2019 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1760 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control of the colonies. The first portion of the game, set in 1754–1755, follows Connor's father, Haytham Kenway, the leader of the Colonial Templars, during the French and Indian War.\nAssassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team-based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Assassin's Creed III, including The Tyranny of King Washington, a story expansion set in an alternate timeline from the base game's events.\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, who praised it for its gameplay, narrative, setting, and ambitious scale, while criticism was directed at the unevenly developed gameplay mechanics, mission design, and pacing. It was a commercial success, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. Assassin's Creed III was released alongside a spin-off for the PlayStation Vita titled Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. A sequel, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, was released in October 2013; while its modern-day narrative continues from the events of Assassin's Creed III, the main plot is set during the Golden Age of Piracy in the early 18th century and follows Connor's grandfather, Edward Kenway.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP0001-CUSA11560_00-AC3GAMEPS4000001"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pUhraVG7Ow"},"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin's Creed III (2012), but its modern-day sequences succeed III's own. Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It was later re-released on the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin's Creed Rogue in December 2019.\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and antagonist Haytham Kenway, respectively, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is sought by both the Assassins and the Templars. A major plot element concerns the attempted establishment of an independent Pirate republic in the Caribbean.\nUnlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game's setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Black Flag, including Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry, a story expansion that was later made available as a standalone game in 2014. Set over a decade after Black Flag's main campaign, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, Edward's former quartermaster who became an Assassin.\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag received critical acclaim and was one of the best-selling games of 2013, with over 15 million copies sold as of 2020. Critics praised the open world gameplay, improved naval combat, side-quests, graphics, narrative, characters, and pirate theme. However, the modern-day story and combat received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game.

Created by Patrice Désilets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and figures. In the majority of the games, players control a historical Assassin, while also playing as an Assassin Initiate or someone caught in the Assassin-Templar conflict in the present-day framing story. Considered a spiritual successor to the Prince of Persia series, Assassin's Creed took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical Hashashin sect of the medieval Middle East.\nThe series' eponymous first title was released in 2007, and it has featured twelve main games in total, the most recent being 2020's Valhalla. Main games in the Assassin's Creed series are set in an open world and played from the third-person perspective. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles (beginning with 2010's Brotherhood) also include competitive and co-operative multiplayer game modes.\nA new story and occasional new time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three overarching story arcs in the series. The first five main games follow Desmond Miles, a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the Animus to relive his ancestors' memories and find powerful artifacts called \"Pieces of Eden\", while also attempting to prevent a catastrophic event said to wipe out humanity by the end of 2012. From Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and until Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Assassin initiates and employees of Abstergo (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars) record genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest three games, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla, follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.\nThe main games in the Assassin's Creed franchise have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism for the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs, as well as a shift towards the prioritising of role-playing mechanics in later titles. The series has received multiple awards and nominations, including several Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 155 million copies as of October 2020, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time. While main titles are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games have been released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and novels have been also been published. In 2016, a live-action film adaptation of Assassin's Creed was released, receiving generally negative reviews from fans and critics.\n\n","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 15, 2016","price":"$19.29","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Ezio-Collection-PlayStation-4/dp/B01LXHDC8I"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZPQ2ijCgVw"},"Assassin's Creed Odyssey":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed Odyssey","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Quebec","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a 2018 action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It is the eleventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Like its predecessor Assassin's Creed Origins, the game features a large open world and adopts many elements from the role-playing genre, putting more emphasis on combat and exploration than stealth. Naval combat from previous titles in the series also plays a prominent role in Odyssey. The game's setting, while fictional, is based on real-world events. It tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta from 431 to 422 BC. Players control a Spartan mercenary, who fights on both sides of the conflict, as they attempt to find their family and eliminate the mysterious Cult of Kosmos. Odyssey also continues the story arc of Layla Hassan, a major character introduced in Origins, who relives the mercenary's memories through the Animus device as part of her efforts to locate a powerful artifact on behalf of the Assassin Brotherhood.\nDevelopment of the game commenced shortly following the release of Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Following in the footsteps of Origins, Odyssey facilitated the transition of Assassin's Creed into a series of action role-playing games by introducing player choice mechanics. Compared with other games in the series, Odyssey has a larger focus on historical mythology, and a smaller focus on the conflict between the Assassins and Templars, which is the central narrative element present in most Assassin's Creed games. Throughout the game's development, the team was inspired by other contemporary RPG titles including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Fallout. The music of the game was composed by The Flight.\nOdyssey was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 5, 2018. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its gameplay, graphics, characters, role-playing elements, and world design, but was criticised for its overambitiousness, pacing, and the inclusion of microtransactions. The prioritization of role-playing mechanics over traditional Assassin's Creed elements also drew a mixed response from critics and players. Odyssey was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide by March 2020. Ubisoft supported the game extensively following its launch, releasing two paid expansions and a Discovery Tour mode, which includes a series of guided tours that allow players to explore the world of Classical Greece for educational purposes. Odyssey was followed in November 2020 by Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which features a historical setting in medieval England and Norway during the Viking expansion across Europe and concludes Layla's story arc.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Oct 5, 2018","price":"$19.30","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Odyssey-PlayStation-4-Standard/dp/B07DKYN13M"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ddQqzwH__4"},"Assassin's Creed: Origins":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed: Origins","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Origins is a 2017 action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, following 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Principally set in Egypt, near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–43 BC), the story follows a Medjay named Bayek of Siwa and his wife Aya, and explores the origins of the millennia-long conflict between the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood—who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order. The narrative also includes sequences set during the 21st century, which follow a new character, Layla Hassan. Origins marked the shift of the series, which up until that point consisted mainly of action-adventure games, towards a new genre, and introduced an overhauled \"hitbox-based\" combat system.\nThe game's development began following the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag in 2013. Ubisoft Montreal led its four-year development with help from a team of nearly 700 people from other Ubisoft studios around the world. The team consulted Egyptologists and historians extensively to ensure the setting was authentically represented in the game. While Assassin's Creed had been an annual franchise since Assassin's Creed II (2009), an extra year of development time allowed the team to polish the game further. This was largely a response to the tepid sales of Syndicate, and the troubled launch of Assassin's Creed Unity, which was plagued with technical issues when it was released in 2014.\nAnnounced at E3 2017, Origins was released on October 27, 2017, for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It received positive reviews from critics, with many calling it an improvement over previous entries and praising the story, characters, voice acting, reworked gameplay systems, world design, historical accuracy, and the visuals. However, the game also drew criticism for its pacing, quest design, and technical issues. The game has sold over ten million units worldwide and was nominated for several end-of-year accolades. Ubisoft supported Origins extensively following its launch, releasing two paid expansions and a Discovery Tour, a series of guided tours that allow players to explore the world of Ptolemaic Egypt for educational purposes. A sequel, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which is set in Classical Greece during the Peloponnesian War, was released in October 2018.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Oct 27, 2017","price":"$17.94","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Origins-PlayStation-4-Standard/dp/B071JD44NW"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK4iAjzAoas"},"Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Sofia","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Rogue is a 2014 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Sofia and published by Ubisoft. It is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and is set between 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and 2012's Assassin's Creed III. It also has ties to Assassin's Creed Unity, which was released on the same day as Rogue. It is the last Assassin's Creed game to be developed for the seventh generation of consoles, being released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014, and for Microsoft Windows in March 2015. A remastered version of the game was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018. It was also released on the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Black Flag in December 2019.The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set during the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who uncovers various secrets about the Assassin-Templar conflict while attempting to fix the company's servers. The main plot is set before and during the French and Indian War from 1752 to 1760, and follows Shay Patrick Cormac, an Irish American Assassin-turned-Templar who hunts down former members of his Brotherhood after becoming disillusioned with their tactics. Gameplay in Rogue is very similar to that of Black Flag with a mixture of ship-based naval exploration and third-person land-based exploration, though some new features have been added.\nUpon release, Rogue received a mixed reception, with praise directed at the game's twist on the traditional formula by playing as a Templar, the mature storyline, complex protagonist, and sophisticated depiction of the Assassin-Templar conflict, as well as the additions to the franchise's lore and the naval warfare gameplay. However, it was criticized for failing to innovate the series' formula and its similarities to Black Flag.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Mar 20, 2018","price":"$21.94","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Rogue-Remastered-Playstation-4/dp/B0797HP2DP"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk9qNzGqofE"},"Assassin's Creed Syndicate":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed Syndicate","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Quebec","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Syndicate is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It was released on October 23, 2015, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on November 19, 2015, for Microsoft Windows. It is the ninth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity.\nThe game's plot follows the premise of the Assassin's Creed franchise, involving a fictional history of real-world events where a secret war has been fought for centuries between two factions: the Brotherhood of Assassins, who promote peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and follows the same unnamed and unseen protagonist from Assassin's Creed Unity, who assists the Assassins in their race against the Templars to find an artifact hidden in London. The main story is set in London in 1868, at the onset of the Second Industrial Revolution, and follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organised crime and take back the city from Templar control. The narrative also includes segments set in 1916, during World War I, which follow Jacob's granddaughter, Lydia Frye.\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its open world is navigated on foot or by carriage. The game introduces new travelling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics. Players control the two lead protagonists throughout the game's story, switching between them both during and outside of missions. After launch, the game was supported with several releases of downloadable content (DLC), including three story expansions. The most notable of these, Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper, is set twenty years after the main campaign, and involves Evie's pursuit of the titular unidentified serial killer, who is also playable.\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate received positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, characters, narrative, and level design. However, the combat, open-world design and vehicle gameplay were met with some criticism. The game was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Action/Adventure at The Game Awards 2015. Syndicate was less financially successful than previous entries in the series, selling roughly 5.5 million copies by November 2017. It was followed in October 2017 by Assassin's Creed Origins, which introduces a new storyline in the modern day and has its main plot set in Ptolemaic era Ancient Egypt.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP0001-CUSA02376_00-ACVPOSTSTANDEURP"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTBbwgsyxvg"},"Assassin's Creed Unity":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed Unity","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Toronto","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Unity is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released in February 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and in January 2020 for Stadia. It is the eighth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. It also has ties to Assassin's Creed Rogue, which was released for the previous generation consoles on the same day as Unity.\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features an unidentified and unseen protagonist, who joins the Assassins as an initiate to help them locate the corpse of an 18th-century Templar Grand Master. The main story is set in Paris during the French Revolution from 1789 to 1794, and follows Assassin Arno Dorian and his efforts to expose the true powers behind the Revolution, while seeking revenge against those responsible for his adoptive father's murder. Unity retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing a revamped combat, parkour, and stealth systems. The game also introduces cooperative multiplayer to the Assassin's Creed series, letting up to four players engage in narrative-driven missions and explore the open world map.\nAssassin's Creed Unity received mixed reviews upon release. It was praised for its visuals, customization options, setting, and characterization. Critics were more polarized on its narrative, mission design, multiplayer-oriented format, and gameplay, with the latter in particular complimented for its improvements, but criticized for a lack of innovation and for feeling unrefined. The game was also widely panned for its numerous graphical issues and bugs, prompting Ubisoft to issue an apology and offer compensation in the form of a free story expansion, Dead Kings, set after the events of the main campaign. Those who had bought the game's season pass (which was later made unavailable for purchase in response to the controversy) received a free copy of another Ubisoft title of their choice.\nIn the years since Unity's release, after most of the technical issues were resolved, the game has undergone positive critical re-evaluations, and is retrospectively considered to be an underrated and under-appreciated title in the Assassin's Creed series. Despite the initial critical backlash, the game was a favorable commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide, and saw a resurgence in sales in the early 2020s. Unity was followed in October 2015 by Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which continues the modern-day narrative, but has its main plot set in Victorian era London.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP0001-CUSA00605_00-AC5GAMEPS4000001"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzCEdSKMkdU"},"Assassin's Creed Valhalla":{"Title":"Assassin's Creed Valhalla","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ubisoft Montreal","Publisher(s)":"Ubisoft","Description":"Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Principally set in the years 872–878 AD, the game recounts a fictional story during the Viking expansions into the British Isles. Players control Eivor Varinsdottir, a Viking raider who, while attempting to establish a new Viking clan in England, becomes embroiled in the centuries-old conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight for peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control. The modern-day portion of the story is set in the 21st century and follows Layla Hassan, an Assassin who relives Eivor's memories so as to find a way to save the Earth from destruction.\nDevelopment of the game began in 2017, around the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Ubisoft Montreal led its three-year development with help from fourteen other Ubisoft studios worldwide, as well as Sperasoft. Numerous people involved in the development of past Assassin's Creed games returned for Valhalla, including Ashraf Ismail, who served as the creative director for Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (2013) and Origins; Darby McDevitt, the lead writer for Black Flag and Assassin's Creed: Revelations (2011) and co-writer of Assassin's Creed Unity (2014); and composers Jesper Kyd and Sarah Schachner, who composed the game's music alongside Einar Selvik. Similarly to Origins and Odyssey, the team conducted extensive research into the time period to make the game world as historically accurate as possible, and drew inspiration from Norse mythology for certain narrative elements. The team also sought to address some issues found by players with Odyssey, such as its over ambitiousness, small focus on the Assassin-Templar conflict, and the absence of traditional Assassin's Creed gameplay elements like social stealth.\nValhalla was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, and Stadia on November 10, 2020, with the PlayStation 5 version following on November 12. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for the narrative, characters, voice acting, visuals, soundtrack, world-design and the interconnectivity of activities, while being criticized for its length, technical issues, and repetitive structure. It also initially generated some controversy among players for Ubisoft's perceived prioritization of microtransactions over game updates. The game had the biggest launch in the Assassin's Creed series to date, selling the most copies within its first week and becoming the second most profitable Ubisoft title of all time. Ubisoft supported Valhalla with several releases of downloadable content, including three paid story expansions, various in-game events, and a Discovery Tour mode, a series of guided tours that allow players to explore the world of Medieval England and Norway for educational purposes.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 10, 2020","price":"$23.99","purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10000237"},{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Nov 12, 2020","price":"$24.99","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-PlayStation-5-Standard/dp/B08FS5HKTR"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Assassin's Creed Valhalla","price":"$36.00","purchaseUrl":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-valhalla"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssrNcwxALS4"},"Assault Android Cactus":{"Title":"Assault Android Cactus","Genre(s)":"Shoot 'em up","Developer(s)":"Witch Beam","Publisher(s)":"Witch Beam","Description":"Assault Android Cactus is a twin stick shoot 'em up developed and published by Witch Beam.

Interactive Entertainment. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, and the fourth main installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Written by Sefton Hill, Ian Ball and Martin Lancaster, Arkham Knight is inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. Set nine months after the events of 2011's Batman: Arkham City, the game's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City, causing a citywide evacuation. Scarecrow, with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight, plots to unite Batman's greatest foes in an attempt to finally destroy Batman.\nThe game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman's melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Batman can freely move around the open world of Gotham City, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage, while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area, using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies. Arkham Knight introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, which is used for transportation, puzzle solving and combat.\nDevelopment on Arkham Knight began in 2011 after completion of Arkham City and took place over four years. Rocksteady opted to use its own writers for the main story with collaboration by comic book writer Geoff Johns, choosing to replace Paul Dini who had worked on Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. The introduction of the Batmobile required a change in the team's design methodology, as the previous games' city designs were too narrow and confined to allow smooth travel for the vehicle.\nArkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23, 2015 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows. The console versions of the game received generally favorable reviews, with praise directed at its visuals, gameplay, combat, and world design, with the most criticism directed at the storytelling, overuse of the Batmobile and the portrayal of the Arkham Knight character. The Windows version was subject to significant criticism for technical and performance issues that rendered it unplayable for some users, prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw it from sale. At release, the game was the fastest selling game of 2015, and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015.

The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner but is instead a \"sidequel\", telling an original story, which runs parallel to the film's plot, occasionally intersecting with it.\nSet in 2019 Los Angeles, the game tells the story of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of dangerous replicants (bioengineered androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film's characters appear in the game, with some of the original actors returning to voice them, the film's protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film's soundtrack.\nBlade Runner was advertised as a \"real-time 3D adventure game,\" since it was one of the first adventure games to use both 3D character rendering and a game world which progressed in real-time (as opposed to waiting for the player's actions). Unlike many games of its time, which used polygon-based renderers exploiting 3D accelerators, Westwood opted for their own software-based renderer using voxel technology.\nThe game received generally positive reviews, and was a commercial success, selling over one million units worldwide. It went on to win the Interactive Achievement Award for \"Computer Adventure Game of the Year,\" and was nominated for \"Best Adventure Game\" by PC Gamer. Virgin Interactive wanted Westwood to make a sequel, but it was thought the cost of production would make the game commercially unviable, and the idea was scrapped. For many years, it remained trapped in legal and intellectual property entanglement, preventing a re-release on digital storefronts, until it finally arrived on GOG.com in December 2019.

Initially teased in 2017, the project was halted as the publisher was uncertain about the size of the market for a game about cross-dressing; development was eventually greenlit after they had gauged interest through Twitter and built a following by serializing Daukokudo Ikuya's manga Bokuhime-sama to Otome Shugi. Other related media include three short audio dramas and an upcoming short story; Jobana has also mentioned that he wants to develop a sequel to the game set in the Meiji era (1868–1912).\nCritics liked the game, calling its themes unique, and praising its story, characters and visuals, but were divided in their opinion on the gameplay. It was ranked as a highly anticipated game among Japanese players in a survey conducted by Famitsu, and almost sold out at online retailers during its first weeks on sale; the developers later described the game as a moderate success.

Ports were developed and released for Microsoft Windows in April 2009, Mac OS X in May 2009, PlayStation 3 in November 2009, and Linux in December 2010. Jonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in video game development. He self-funded the three-year project, working with webcomic artist David Hellman to develop the artwork. An anniversary version is planned for release at a later date for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Windows, Mac, and Linux with updated graphics and developer commentary.\nThe basic story elements in Braid unfold as the protagonist, Tim, attempts to rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditionally defining aspects of the platform genre while also integrating various novel powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses through the game by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.\nA preliminary version of Braid (without the final artwork) won the \"Innovation in Game Design\" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival, while the final version received additional accolades. The game received critical acclaim, eventually becoming the highest rated title on Xbox Live. Some reviewers, however, criticized the game's price relative to its length of play. It is seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development, and Blow and its production were documented in the 2012 film, Indie Game: The Movie. The game had total revenue nearing $6 million, as of 2015, which Blow used to fund his next game, The Witness, a 3D puzzle game released in 2016. Braid is considered by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://www.allkeyshop.com/blog/buy-braid-anniversary-edition-ps4-compare-prices/"},{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://blog.playstation.com/2020/08/06/announcing-braid-anniversary-edition-for-ps4-and-ps5/"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Braid Anniversary Edition","price":"$9.99","purchaseUrl":"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/braid/BZGPBRQ3LZ7G"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf9A1QPG_yc"},"Brawl":{"Title":"Brawl","Genre(s)":["Action","party"],"Developer(s)":"Bloober Team","Publisher(s)":"Bloober Team","Description":"Basement Crawl is an action game for PlayStation 4.

It was designed by Steve Wozniak, based on conceptualization from Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow who were influenced by the seminal 1972 Atari arcade game Pong. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them. The arcade game was released in Japan by Namco. Breakout was a worldwide commercial success, among the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976 in both the United States and Japan and then among the top three highest-grossing arcade video games of 1977 in the US and Japan. The 1978 Atari VCS port uses color graphics instead of a monochrome screen with colored overlay. \nWhile the concept was predated by Ramtek's Clean Sweep (1974), Breakout spawned an entire genre of clones. It was the inspiration for aspects of the Apple II computer and Taito's Space Invaders (1978). An official  sequel was released in 1978, Super Breakout, which eventually became the pack-in game for the Atari 5200 console in 1982. Super Breakout introduced multiple balls in play at once, which became a common feature in the genre. In 1986 the Breakout concept found new legs with Taito's Arkanoid, which itself spawned dozens of imitators. In Japan, the genre is known as block kuzushi (\"block breaker\") games.\n\n","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Feb 10, 2022","price":"$9.99","purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0182-CUSA31473_00-7152618566166813/"},{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Feb 10, 2022","price":"$9.99","purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0182-CUSA31473_00-7152618566166813/"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Breakout: Recharged","price":"$9.99","purchaseUrl":"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/breakout-recharged/9p7178rs82s7"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuUe_BcHOYU"},"The Bridge":{"Title":"The Bridge","Genre(s)":"Puzzle","Developer(s)":"TQAG","Publisher(s)":"TQAG","Description":"The Bridge is a video game designed by American developer Ty Taylor for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, Amazon Fire TV, Android, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Ouya, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.

The game's development was chronicled by an episodic series of documentaries produced by 2 Player Productions.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Apr 28, 2015","price":"$69.97","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Age-Limited-Run-PlayStation-4/dp/B0738P35VY"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjJAMM1MyTA"},"Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse":{"Title":"Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse","Genre(s)":"Point-and-click adventure","Developer(s)":"Revolution Software","Publisher(s)":"Revolution Software","Description":"Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse is the fifth title in the Broken Sword series of adventure video games, developed and published by Revolution Software, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation Vita (via the PlayStation Network), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Android and iOS.

It was distributed in the United States by Romstar, and in Europe by Electrocoin. Players control Bub and Bob, two dragons that set out to save their girlfriends from a world known as the Cave of Monsters. In each level, Bub and Bob must defeat each enemy present by trapping them in bubbles and popping, who turn into bonus items when they hit the ground. There are 100 levels total, each becoming progressively more difficult.\nBubble Bobble was designed by Fukio \"MTJ\" Mitsuji. When he joined Taito in 1986, he felt that Taito's game output was of mediocre quality. In response, he decided to make a game that was fun to play and could rejuvenate the company's presence in the industry. Mitsuji hoped his game would appeal to women, specifically couples that visited arcades. As such, he decided to make Bubble Bobble focus largely on its two player co-operative mode. He made bubbles the core mechanic as he thought they would be a fun element that girls would enjoy.\nBubble Bobble became one of Taito's biggest arcade successes, and is credited with inspiring the creation of many similar screen-clear platform games that followed. It was acclaimed by critics for its character design, memorable soundtrack, gameplay, and multiplayer, and is often listed among the greatest games of all time. Bubble Bobble was followed by a long list of sequels and successors for multiple platforms; one of these, Puzzle Bobble, has become successful in its own right and spawned its own line of sequels.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 17, 2020","price":"$29.99","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Bubble-Bobble-Friends-Baron-PlayStation-4/dp/B08HDPJLD3"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w-PeZnf44o"},"Bubsy: Paws on Fire!":{"Title":"Bubsy: Paws on Fire!","Genre(s)":"Platform","Developer(s)":"Choice Provisions","Publisher(s)":"UFO Interactive Games","Description":"Bubsy: Paws on Fire! is a platform video game developed by Choice Provisions and published by Accolade, Inc.

The game is distinguished by its system of rewarding players with \"skillpoints\" for performing increasingly creative kills. Bulletstorm does not have any competitive multiplayer modes, preferring instead to include cooperative online play and score attack modes. Set in the 26th century, the game's story follows Grayson Hunt, a space pirate and former black ops soldier who gets shot down on a war-torn planet while trying to exact revenge on General Sarrano, his former commander who tricked him and his men into committing war crimes and assassinating innocents.\nDevelopment of the game began in June 2007. Adrian Chmielarz and Cliff Bleszinski served as its director and designer respectively, while Rick Remender, the author of Fear Agent, wrote the game's story. It was originally envisioned to be a cover-based third-person shooter, though the core combat loop and gameplay perspective went through multiple revisions. Pulp fiction, Burnout, Duke Nukem and Firefly all inspired the team during Bulletstorm's development. The team experimented with competitive multiplayer modes and campaign cooperative multiplayer mode during production, but decided to remove them because of technological constraints.\nUpon its release in February 2011 for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the game received positive reviews from critics who praised its setting, graphics, action, pacing and gameplay, but was criticized for its story, writing and multiplayer modes. It has amassed a great deal of controversy during its release window for its depiction of violence. Bulletstorm was a commercial failure for both Epic Games and Electronic Arts, selling one million copies by 2013. Gearbox Publishing released a remastered version of the game titled Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition in April 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and a version for Nintendo Switch in August 2019.

Instead, it features the Solo Missions mode, which focuses on the backstories of the game's multiplayer characters, known as \"Specialists\". The missions take place between Black Ops II and III chronologically. Some of the Specialists also carried over from Black Ops III. The multiplayer mode is the first in the series to not feature automatic health regeneration and introduces both predictive recoil and a new ballistics system. The game included three Zombies maps on release day, four if a special edition of the game, or the Black Ops Pass, was purchased. The locations of the maps include the RMS Titanic, an Gladiatorial Arena in Roman Egypt, and Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. The game also introduced a battle royale mode called Blackout, which features up to 100 players in each match. Many characters from this and other Black Ops titles can be used as the player's character model in this mode.\nDevelopment for the game started shortly after the release of Black Ops III. Treyarch chose not to create a campaign mode for the game at the beginning of development, instead putting all of their focus on the multiplayer aspect. They cited an increased interest for multiplayer and lack of time spent by the playerbase on the campaign mode as reasons why they shifted their focus. Black Ops 4 utilizes Blizzard's Battle.net platform for the Windows version instead of Steam, the first game in the series to do so. Teasing of the game began in March 2018, with a full reveal taking place later in May. Two betas were held for the game; one for the multiplayer in August and one for Blackout in September. The release date was moved up to October instead of the series' usual November in an attempt to avoid coinciding with the release of other high-profile games.\nPre-release reception of the game was negative due to the game's lack of a campaign mode and the Black Ops Pass, a season pass that distributes downloadable content (DLC) in the form of \"Operations\". Black Ops 4 received positive reviews upon release, with praise towards its three modes, particularly Blackout, while it received criticism for the game's lack of a campaign mode and the design of its microtransactions implemented in updates. Despite physical retail sales for the game being the lowest in the series in a decade, it was the best-selling digital launch in Activision's history, surpassing 2017's Call of Duty: WWII.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Oct 12, 2018","price":"$19.95","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Black-Ops-PlayStation-Standard/dp/B072MKR1RL"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Call+of+Duty%3A+Black+Ops+III+video+game+trailer"},"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War":{"Title":"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":["Raven Software","Treyarch"],"Publisher(s)":"Activision","Description":"Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a 2020 first-person shooter video game developed by Treyarch and Raven Software and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on November 13, 2020, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It serves as the sixth installment in the Black Ops series and the seventeenth installment in the overall Call of Duty series. The game is the second Call of Duty title since 2011's Modern Warfare 3 to be co-developed by two studios.\nBlack Ops Cold War's campaign is set during the early 1980s of the Cold War, taking place between Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010) and Black Ops II (2012) chronologically. It is centered around a pursuit of the alleged Soviet spy Perseus, whose stated goal is to subvert the United States and tilt the balance of power toward the Soviet Union. For the campaign, the player takes control of \"Bell\", who is recruited by CIA officer Russell Adler into a multinational task force created to hunt down Perseus. The campaign also sees the return of Black Ops characters Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Jason Hudson, with Mason also being the playable character in certain missions. The game's multiplayer introduced new game modes as well as new map dynamics and elements, carrying over several design choices introduced in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. It features a seasonal content system similar to Modern Warfare, which includes a battle pass as well as free maps and weapons added every season. Cold War also features narrative tie-ins to Modern Warfare via the campaign and multiplayer, establishing a shared universe across multiple Call of Duty sub-series.\nThe game was originally developed by Raven and Sledgehammer Games and not intended to be an entry in the Black Ops subseries. However, the development suffered from disagreements among the two teams, resulting in Activision placing Treyarch in charge of the game's development in 2019, with Raven acting as a co-developer to them. Marketing for the game began in August 2020 and was done in different forms, including certain content creators receiving slide projectors, puzzles made to be solved online by fans, and a website showcasing historical Cold War events. A public multiplayer beta for the game was also made live in October 2020. Black Ops Cold War received generally favorable reviews from critics, with praise for the campaign, multiplayer and zombies while criticizing its technical issues and lack of innovation, and became the best-selling game of 2020 in the US.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 13, 2020","price":"$59.99","purchaseUrl":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0002-CUSA15010_00-CODCWSTANDARD001"},{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Nov 13, 2020","price":"$44.95","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Black-Cold-PlayStation-5/dp/B08GR4GNRK"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":null,"price":null,"purchaseUrl":"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTS9n_m7TW0"},"Call of Duty: Ghosts":{"Title":"Call of Duty: Ghosts","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Infinity Ward","Publisher(s)":"Activision","Description":"Call of Duty: Ghosts is a 2013 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision.

It is the first title by Infinity Ward under the new three-year development cycle for the Call of Duty series. The game's campaign is centered around a battle for the Solar System, which the Settlement Defense Front (SDF), a hostile force who are the main antagonists, are attempting to take over. The player takes control of Lieutenant Nick Reyes of the Special Combat Air Recon (SCAR). They have their own transforming fighter, named \"Jackal\", that they can customize as well as a central hub ship named Retribution.\nInfinite Warfare's announcement trailer was noted for its strong negative reaction; it was the second-most-disliked video on YouTube at the time. Commentators attributed this to Call of Duty fans expressing frustration at the direction the series had taken, specifically that the game and its predecessors had futuristic settings. Nevertheless, the game received generally positive reviews upon release; it received praise for its gameplay, characters, and Zombies mode, but criticism for its multiplayer mode, while its single-player campaign received mixed opinions. It was named as Best Shooter at E3 by Game Informer and was nominated for several awards. Infinite Warfare underperformed in sales compared to previous Call of Duty titles, though it was the top-selling game in the US in November 2016.\nSpecial editions of Infinite Warfare were released with a remastered version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, entitled Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 4, 2016","price":"$20.00","purchaseUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Infinite-Warfare-PlayStation-4/dp/B01EZA0CEE"}],"trailerURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeF3UTkCoxY"},"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare":{"Title":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Infinity Ward","Publisher(s)":"Activision","Description":"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a 2019 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision.

The campaign follows a CIA officer and British SAS forces as they team up with rebels from the fictional country of Urzikstan, combating together against Russian forces who have invaded the country and the terrorist group Al-Qatala. The game's Special Ops mode features cooperative play missions that follow on from the campaign. The multiplayer mode supports cross-platform multiplayer and cross-platform progression for the first time in the series. It has been reworked for gameplay to be more tactical and introduces new features, such as a Realism mode that removes the HUD as well as a form of the Ground War mode that now supports 64 players. A post-launch update introduces a free-to-play battle royale mode, Warzone, which was also marketed as a standalone title.\nInfinity Ward began working on the game soon after the release of their 2016 title Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. They introduced an entirely new engine for the game, which allows for new performance enhancements such as more detailed environments and ray-tracing capabilities. For the campaign, they took influence from real-life conflicts, such as the Syrian Civil War and terrorist incidents that have occurred in London. For the multiplayer, they scrapped the franchise's traditional season pass and removed loot boxes, enabling them to distribute free post-launch content to the playerbase in the form of \"Seasons\".Modern Warfare received praise for its gameplay, campaign, multiplayer, and graphics; criticism focused on the handling of the campaign's subject matter, including the depiction of the Russian military, as well as balancing issues in the multiplayer.

A standalone version was released for these platforms in mid-2017. The game's story follows the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and the Special Air Service (SAS), who take on missions to fight against a separatist group in the Middle East and an ultranationalist group in Russia.\nDevelopment began after an online petition requesting a Modern Warfare remaster began circulation. Activision enlisted Raven Software—who had assisted in the development of past Call of Duty games—to develop Modern Warfare Remastered, while original developer Infinity Ward supervised. Modern Warfare Remastered features extensive graphical enhancements, updated animations, and revised original sound effects as well as new ones. It retains the original core gameplay, with small adjustments. New multiplayer content, and additional single-player achievements and cheats are included.\nCritics lauded Modern Warfare Remastered for its enhanced graphics, revised sound, and range of other modifications. They praised the gameplay for what was considered a challenging and innovative single-player campaign when compared to later games in the series. The multiplayer mode was complimented for its simplicity and freshness. Criticism focused on the multiplayer mode for balancing issues and the single-player mode for its pacing and artificial intelligence.

The game's main playable characters are Sergeant Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson, of the 141, and Private James Ramirez, of the Army Rangers, with Captain MacTavish becoming playable later in the campaign. An expansive multiplayer mode is featured in the game, with several new features and modes that were not seen in its predecessor.\nDevelopment for the game began in 2008, when it was still known as Call of Duty 6. It uses the IW 4.0 engine, an improved version of Call of Duty 4's IW 3.0. Infinity Ward was inspired by real-life conflicts when developing the campaign mode. They initially tested the multiplayer mode by playing an in-house beta version of the game. Modern Warfare 2 was officially announced in February 2009. Teasing of the game began in March, with short trailers being released for the game and, eventually, a full reveal trailer. The multiplayer mode was revealed shortly after.

In addition to its release, a comic book series based on one of the game's characters was also produced, titled Modern Warfare 2: Ghost.

While the developers felt they had the technical expertise to expand to a full city simulation game, their publisher Paradox held off on the idea, fearing the market dominance of SimCity. After the critical failure of the 2013 SimCity game, however, Paradox greenlit the title. The developer's goal was to create a game engine capable of simulating the daily routines of nearly a million unique citizens, while presenting this to the player in a simple way, allowing the player to easily understand various problems in their city's design. This includes realistic traffic congestion, and the effects of congestion on city services and districts. Since the game's release, various expansions and other DLC have been released for the game. The game also has built-in support for user-generated content.\nThe game was first released for the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems in March 2015, with ports to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 game consoles being released in 2017 and for the Nintendo Switch in September 2018 developed by Tantalus Media.

Players do this by exploring the world, founding new cities, building city improvements, deploying military troops to attack and defend from others, researching new technologies and civics advancements, developing an influential culture, and engaging in trade and negotiations with other world leaders.\nThe game features several civilizations not featured in previous incarnations of Civilization, while many returning civilizations have new capitals or new leaders. A critical design focus was to avoid having the player follow a pre-set path of improvements towards their civilization which they had observed from earlier games. New to Civilization VI is the use of districts outside the city center to house most of the buildings. For example, a campus district must be built in order to house science-based buildings. Other new features include research on the game's technology tree based on nearby terrain, a similar technology tree for cultural improvements and a better government civics structure for those playing on a cultural victory path.

It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it was the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a \"mythic science fiction\" world, the game features a multiplayer \"shared-world\" environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"strikes\" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.\nPlayers take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding new content, missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of Destiny featured two small expansions, The Dark Below in December 2014 and House of Wolves in May 2015. A third, larger expansion, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition. Another large expansion called Rise of Iron was released in September 2016, beginning Year Three. Rise of Iron was only released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 clients subsequently stopped receiving content updates. The base game and all four expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Collection. A sequel, Destiny 2, released in September 2017.\nUpon its release, Destiny received generally positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay, graphics, and for maintaining lineage from the Halo franchise, particularly in regards to its competitive experiences. Criticism centered mostly around the game's storyline and post-campaign content. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold over US$325 million at retail in its first five days, making it the biggest new franchise launch of all time. It was GamesRadar's 2014 Game of the Year and it received the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the 2014 British Academy Video Games Awards.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Sep 9, 2014"}]},"Destiny 2":{"Title":"Destiny 2","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Bungie","Publisher(s)":"Activision","Description":"Destiny 2  (also known as Destiny 2: New Light and in Korea as Destiny: Guardians) is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie.

It became free-to-play, utilizing the games as a service model, under the New Light title on October 1, 2019, followed by the game's release on Stadia the following month, and then PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S platforms in December 2020. The game was published by Activision until December 31, 2018, when Bungie acquired the publishing rights to the franchise.

Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \"strikes\" and dungeons and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as activities not available in the original. These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.\nPlayers assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect humanity from different alien races and combat the looming threat of the Darkness.

Year One of Destiny 2 featured two small expansions, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. A third, large expansion, Forsaken, began Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The release of the next expansion, Shadowkeep (October 2019) began Year Three. Shadowkeep and future releases are considered standalone releases, not requiring players to own previous premium content. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of Destiny 2 called New Light, a free-to-play re-release of Destiny 2, which also included access to the first two expansions. Separate seasonal passes also became available for each season's content. While the main Destiny 2 game has since been free-to-play, all other content requires purchasing.\nYear Four saw the biggest overhaul on the game, as nearly half of the game's content from its first three years, including the original base campaign as well as Curse of Osiris and Warmind, were removed from the game and placed into what Bungie calls the Destiny Content Vault. Alongside this change, Year Four began with the fifth expansion, Beyond Light, which introduced the power of Darkness to the players. Bungie described this expansion as the beginning of a new era for the franchise, as it will be followed up by The Witch Queen in early 2022 and  Lightfall in early 2023. There will also be a final chapter, The Final Shape, to follow Lightfall to conclude the first saga of Destiny, called the \"Light and Darkness Saga,\" before the beginning of a new saga.\nUpon release, Destiny 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics.

Versions for Linux and macOS systems were released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It is the fourth main title in the Deus Ex series, and a sequel to the 2011 game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The gameplay—combining first-person shooter, stealth, and role-playing elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to the main hub of Prague and quests that grant experience and allow customization of the main character's abilities with Praxis Kits. Conversations between characters have a variety of responses, with options in conversations and at crucial story points affecting how events play out.

Breach was later released as a free, standalone product.\nIn 2029, two years after Human Revolution, the world is divided between normal humans and those with advanced, controversial artificial organs dubbed \"augmentations\". After a violent event known as the Aug Incident, augmented people have been segregated; this prompts heated debate and an era of \"mechanical apartheid\". Main protagonist Adam Jensen, equipped with advanced new augmentations after Human Revolution, is a double agent for the hacker group Juggernaut Collective to expose the Illuminati, which is orchestrating events behind the scenes. The story explores themes of transhumanism and discrimination, using the series' recurring cyberpunk setting and conspiracy theory motif.\nProduction of Mankind Divided began after completion of the Human Revolution expansion The Missing Link. Eidos Montréal wanted to improve its gameplay and narrative, and address criticism from fans and reviewers of Human Revolution. The gameplay and graphics engine were rebuilt from scratch for next-generation hardware. A greater focus on realism and the story's darker themes resulted in a subdued color range compared to the previous game. Human Revolution composer Michael McCann returned to write the score with newcomers Sascha Dikiciyan and Ed Harrison. The game was announced in 2015, after a lengthy promotional campaign. Subsequent marketing slogans were criticized by journalists, and a divisive tier-based preorder campaign was cancelled due to player backlash. Post-launch, story-based downloadable content was released in 2016. \nCritical reception of Mankind Divided was generally favorable, with praise for the game's narrative, graphics and gameplay. Criticism focused on the brevity of its campaign, the handling of its themes and inclusion of microtransactions after launch.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Aug 23, 2016"}]},"Devil May Cry HD Collection":{"Title":"Devil May Cry HD Collection","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure, hack and slash","Developer(s)":"Capcom","Publisher(s)":"Capcom","Description":"Devil May Cry (Japanese: デビル メイ クライ, Hepburn: Debiru Mei Kurai) is a series of action-adventure games created by Hideki Kamiya.

Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.\nDuring its two and a half years in production, several versions of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. Dishonored's music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century.\nDishonored received positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. The game won several awards, including the 2012 Spike Video Game award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 BAFTA award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. It has also been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Dishonored was initially released in October 2012, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released in August 2015. In contrast, the re-releases were received negatively compared to the original, with criticisms being directed towards the unstable frame rate, long loading times, and lack of improvements outside of the free downloadable content. Two narrative sequels, Dishonored 2 and Dishonored: Death of the Outsider, were released in 2016 and 2017 respectively.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Aug 25, 2015"}]},"Dishonored 2":{"Title":"Dishonored 2","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Arkane Studios","Publisher(s)":"Bethesda Softworks","Description":"Dishonored 2 is a 2016 action-adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the sequel to 2012's Dishonored. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can alternatively decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. Due to the game's nonlinear gameplay, there are a multitude of ways to complete missions, from non-lethal stealth to purposeful violent conflict.\nIdeas for Dishonored 2 began while developing the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned the decision to create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, a child in Dishonored, was proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented in the span of one year. The city itself was based on Southern European/Mediterranean countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851. Voice actors include Rosario Dawson, Sam Rockwell, Robin Lord Taylor, Jamie Hector, Pedro Pascal, and Vincent D'Onofrio.\nDishonored 2 was released to a positive reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, the realization of the game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders, as well as issues with the PC version at launch, were received unfavorably, and the lack of content at launch was criticized. To remedy these problems, the game was updated numerous times during its life-cycle, with a New Game Plus mode, quick save and quick load feature, and a customizable difficulty setting being added in the game. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 11, 2016"}]},"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider":{"Title":"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider","Genre(s)":["Action-adventure","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Arkane Studios","Publisher(s)":"Bethesda Softworks","Description":"Dishonored: Death of the Outsider is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is a standalone expansion pack following Dishonored 2, and was released 15 September 2017 on Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game takes place in the coastal city of Karnaca after the events of the previous title. It follows the former assassin Billie Lurk as she reunites with her mentor Daud and come up with a plan to kill the mysterious entity known as The Outsider. The game is played from a first-person perspective and the player has access to a variety of supernatural abilities to complete missions in a multitude of ways, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict.\nDeath of the Outsider was originally planned as a downloadable content for Dishonored 2, but became a standalone expansion after the team decided to explore different approaches with its story and gameplay. Lurk was chosen as the protagonist for being a favorite with the developers. The narrative was conceived to tie loose ends left by the previous games, offer a different perspective to the player and end the narrative arc that began with the original Dishonored. Gameplay elements were reformulated or completely removed to differentiate the game from its predecessors, adapt it to the standalone expansion format and encourage the player to experiment and explore their choices.\nThe game was announced during the Bethesda press conference at E3 2017. Death of the Outsider was well received by critics, who praised its game design and considered it a suitable conclusion to the Dishonored series up until that point. However, criticism was focused on its narrative and levels which were considered unremarkable when compared to previous titles in the series. The game was nominated for some industry awards, including Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the Writers Guild of America Awards. After its release, Arkane Studios announced that the Dishonored series would be entering a hiatus.\n\n","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Sep 15, 2017"}]},"Disintegration":{"Title":"Disintegration","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"V1 Interactive","Publisher(s)":"Private Division","Description":"Disintegration is a first-person shooter developed by V1 Interactive and published by Private Division.

It is known for its super deformed characters, and fast-paced, but deep gameplay. Most games in the series are developed under license from the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB)  and the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA), letting them use the  league's team names, stadiums, colors, and players' names and likenesses. There are also six games in the series with the Major League Baseball (MLB) and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) license, two with the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) and Korea Professional Baseball Players Association (KPBPA), and one with the World Baseball Classic license. It is long running in Japan, starting out in 1994 for the Super Famicom, and appearing on many different consoles: the Sega Saturn (1995–1997), the PlayStation (1994–2003), the Nintendo 64 (1997–2001), the PlayStation 2 (2000–2009), the Dreamcast (2000), the Nintendo GameCube (2002–2006), Wii (2007–2009), PlayStation 3 (2010–2016), PlayStation 4 (since 2016) as well as the PlayStation Portable (2007–2013) and the PlayStation Vita (2012-2018).\nThe game also has two spin-off series, Professional Baseball Spirits, a baseball sports simulation series with more realistic graphics and physics, and Power Pro Kun Pocket. The latter was released on handheld systems between 1999 and 2014 with versions for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. Although the series was originally designed as the side-story of Success mode and was part of the main series, Konami retroactively declared it as a separate series.\nOn May 12, 2006, a version of Power Pro was released featuring Major League Baseball players, under the title Jikkyō Powerful Major League. The Power Pro series has featured online play since its tenth incarnation on the PS2 and its first handheld version on the PlayStation Portable. A version of Power Pro was announced for the PlayStation 3, first shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2005, but it would take another five years for the series to reach the PS3, with the system instead getting Power Pro's sister series, Professional Baseball Spirits, for the interim. On August 3, 2007, an American release of the series was announced for both the PlayStation 2 and the Wii. The game, titled MLB Power Pros, was published by 2K Sports, and  features a Success Mode set within Major League Baseball.The most distinctive feature of the Power Pro series is its odd depiction of characters. The basic design of the Power Pro baseball player is a short figure with an excessively wide, gashapon capsule-shaped head, lacking a mouth, nose, ears with expression being mainly in the eyebrows. Power Pros characters are somewhat similar to the character Rayman, in that they do not have legs and thus their feet are not connected to their body. Power Pros characters do have arms and hands; however, their hands are fingerless and bear more resemblance to a sphere than a human hand. The Power Pro series has used this comic design for every single one of its games.\nIn Japan, the series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, while in North America it received mixed to generally favourable reviews and sold poorly. As of December 2020, the series has sold over 23.5 million copies, in addition to 44 million mobile game downloads as of October 2020.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Unreleased"}]},"Echo":{"Title":"Echo","Genre(s)":["Action","stealth"],"Developer(s)":"Ultra Ultra","Publisher(s)":"Ultra Ultra","Description":"Echo (stylized as ECHO) is a stealth video game released in 19 September 2017.

Announced in January 2014, the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2015. Evolve uses an asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where five players—four playing as hunters and one as the monster—battle against each other on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay is based on the first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger before either eliminating the hunters, or successfully destroying the objective.\nEvolve was Turtle Rock Studios' first major project after the company split from Valve in 2010. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the development of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.\nPrior to release, Evolve received a largely positive reception and won the Best of Show Awards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 and Gamescom 2014. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's asymmetrical structure, controls, and designs. However, it received criticism for its progression system and light narrative, gameplay, as well as a large amount of downloadable content prepared. Evolve was a commercial success, although the player base significantly dwindled shortly after release. The game had briefly transitioned to become a free-to-play title known as Evolve Stage 2 before 2K Games shut down the game's dedicated servers in September 2018.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Feb 10, 2015"}]},"Exception":{"Title":"Exception","Genre(s)":["Action","platform"],"Developer(s)":"Traxmaster Software","Publisher(s)":"Traxmaster Software","Description":"Exception is a 2.5D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by American studio Traxmaster Software.

The game was a commercial success, grossing $151 million in its first day of release in Japan, and more than $50 million during its first 13 weeks in North America, making it the fastest-selling Final Fantasy title until Final Fantasy XIII, a multi-platform release. A Microsoft Windows port followed in 2000, with the addition of the Chocobo World minigame.

Final Fantasy XIV takes place in the fictional land of Eorzea, five years after the events of the original 2010 release. At the conclusion of the original game, the primal dragon Bahamut escapes from its lunar prison to initiate the Seventh Umbral Calamity, an apocalyptic event which destroys much of Eorzea. Through the gods' blessing, the player character escapes the devastation by time traveling five years into the future. As Eorzea recovers and rebuilds, the player must deal with the impending threat of invasion by the Garlean Empire from the north.\nThe original Final Fantasy XIV, released in September 2010, was a commercial and critical failure. In response, then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would take over and attempt to fix the issues with it. This team was responsible for generating content for the original version as well as developing a brand new game which would address all of the previous release's criticisms. This new game, initially dubbed \"Version 2.0\", features a new game engine, improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, interface, and story. The original version shut down in November 2012 and was followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.\nThe game released to largely positive reception; critics praised the game for its solid mechanics and progression, and they commended Yoshida for turning the project around. After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix executives attributed the company's 2014 return to profitability in part to the game's strong sales and subscriber base, reaching a total of over 24 million registered players by October 2021, also becoming the most profitable Final Fantasy game to date.

An iOS version was released in September 2017, and a Windows version was released in February 2019, both published by Annapurna Interactive. The game was intended as a \"spiritual successor\" to Flow, a previous title by Chen and Thatgamecompany. In Flower, the player controls the wind, blowing a flower petal through the air using the movement of the game controller. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary wind turbines. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.\nFlower was primarily intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, rather than to be a challenging and \"fun\" game. This focus was sparked by Chen, who felt that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, dynamically responds to the player's actions and corresponds with the emotional cues in the game. Flower was a critical success, to the surprise of the developers. Reviewers praised the game's music, visuals, and gameplay, calling it a unique and compelling emotional experience.

First released for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) console on March 16, 2010, it is the fifth installment in the God of War series, the seventh chronologically, and the sequel to 2007's God of War II. Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the former God of War, after his betrayal at the hands of his father Zeus, King of the Olympian gods. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos ascends Mount Olympus until he is abandoned by the Titan Gaia. Guided by Athena's spirit, Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans in a search for Pandora, without whom he cannot open Pandora's Box, defeat Zeus, and end the reign of the Olympian gods to have his revenge.\nThe gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.\nGod of War III was critically acclaimed upon release, with praise for the graphics, gameplay, and scope, although the plot received mixed reviews. The game received several awards, including \"Most Anticipated Game of 2010\" and \"Best PS3 Game\" at the 2009 and 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, respectively, and the \"Artistic Achievement\" award at the 2011 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Video Game Awards. The second best-selling game in the God of War series and the ninth best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time, it sold nearly 5.2 million copies worldwide by June 2012 and was included in the God of War Saga released for PlayStation 3 on August 28, 2012. Since its release, it has also been named as one of the greatest games of all time. In celebration of the God of War franchise's tenth anniversary, a remastered version of the game, titled God of War III Remastered, was released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) on July 14, 2015. The next game in the series was God of War: Ascension, a prequel to 2005's God of War, which was released on March 12, 2013. A true sequel simply titled God of War that re-imagines the franchise and shifts the setting to Norse mythology was released on April 20, 2018.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Jul 14, 2015"}]},"God of War":{"Title":"God of War","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure","Developer(s)":"Santa Monica Studio","Publisher(s)":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","Description":"God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). It was released in April 2018 for the PlayStation 4, with a Microsoft Windows version released in January 2022. The game is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III.\nUnlike previous games, which were loosely based on Greek mythology, this installment is loosely inspired by Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard. For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, and his young son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife, Atreus' mother, they journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and gods of the Norse world.\nDescribed by creative director Cory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, a major gameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical battle axe instead of his signature double-chained blades. God of War also uses an over-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in one shot, as opposed to the fixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. The game also includes role-playing video game elements, and Kratos' son Atreus provides assistance in combat. The majority of the original game's development team worked on God of War and designed it to be accessible and grounded. A separate short text-based game, A Call from the Wilds, was released in February 2018 and follows Atreus on his first adventure.\nGod of War received universal acclaim for its story, world design, art direction, music, graphics, combat system, and characters, in particular the dynamic between Kratos and Atreus. Many reviewers felt it had successfully revitalized the series without losing the core identity of its predecessors. It has been cited as among the greatest video games of all time, and was awarded Game of the Year by numerous media outlets and award shows. The game also performed well commercially, selling over five million copies within a month of its release and over 19.5 million by August 2021, making it the best-selling PlayStation 4 game as well as the best-selling game in the series. A novelization was released in August 2018, followed by a prequel comic series published from November 2018 to February 2019.

Gone Home does not feature much interactivity, but instead has the player explore the house at their own pace and determine what has transpired by examining items, journals, and other items left around the various rooms. The Fullbright team, having previously worked on BioShock 2: Minerva's Den, took concepts and ideas from that game to craft an exploration game to engage the player in uncovering the narration by non-linear progression by searching the house, while keeping the project manageable for their small team.\nGone Home was critically praised at release. Several outlets used the game as an example of video games as art, as its non-standard gameplay format demonstrates progression of the video game industry into more artistic forms. However, this also raised the question of whether Gone Home should be considered a game, and led to the derogatory term \"walking simulators\" to describe exploration games with little interactivity, though since then, the industry has come to embrace the term. Gone Home's characters and story were praised for addressing LGBT issues with which some players could identify.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Jan 12, 2016"}]},"Gonner":{"Title":"Gonner","Genre(s)":"Roguelike","Developer(s)":"Art in Heart","Publisher(s)":"Raw Fury","Description":"Gonner (stylized as GoNNER) is a roguelike video game developed by Art in Heart and published by Raw Fury.

Following a mercenary group in the employ of different nations formed in the wake of a collapsed empire, the player engages in turn-based combat while navigating paths on maps similar to a board game. Online competitive asynchronous multiplayer where chosen teams of characters fight for a chosen nation was originally featured, but this ended as servers were shut down by 2019 in the West and 2022 in Japan.\nGrand Kingdom began development in 2011 under director Tomohiko Deguchi, a former Vanillaware staff member, using similar design and aesthetic concepts to Grand Knights History (2011). The asynchronous multiplayer was developed to prove its viability in Japan, allowing a casual time investment from players. Manga artist Chizu Hashii designed the characters, who was asked to avoid moe design traits. The music was composed by a team from Basiscape, including Mitsuhiro Kaneda and Masaharu Iwata; it was one of Iwata's last original projects for Basiscape before leaving in 2017.\nThe game was announced in June 2015, when development was around 65% complete. Single-player downloadable content was released in Japan featuring scenarios around the nations and new player units between 2015 and 2016, all of which were bundled into the Western release.

It was developed by Grove Street Games and published by Rockstar Games. All three games are remastered, with visual enhancements and gameplay upgrades. The games feature different protagonists and locations within the same continuity. Grand Theft Auto III follows silent protagonist Claude in Liberty City; Vice City, set in 1986, features ex-mobster Tommy Vercetti in the titular Vice City; and San Andreas, set in 1992, follows gangster Carl \"CJ\" Johnson within the fictional state of San Andreas.\nThe two-year development focused on maintaining the look and feel of the original games; the physics code was copied from the originals, and artificial intelligence was used to automatically upscale textures. The development team studied the distinctive qualities of the original games. They added several colouring, weathering, and lighting effects, as well as new assets from Grand Theft Auto V (2013). The team consulted with the original developers at Rockstar North when upgrading the character designs. Prior to release, existing versions of the three games were removed from sale from digital retailers, which led to criticism from audiences and journalists; in response, Rockstar restored the original versions on the Rockstar Store.\nThe Definitive Edition was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11 November 2021, and is scheduled for release on Android and iOS devices in 2022/2023. The Windows launch was marred by problems with the Rockstar Games Launcher, rendering it unplayable for three days. The game received poor reviews; critics generally praised the enhanced visuals, upgraded lighting, improved controls, and added gameplay mechanics, but criticised its technical problems, art direction, and character models. It was one of the lowest-scoring games of 2021, and was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic.

It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot and by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.\nThe game's development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years.

It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay.

It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 165 million copies shipped, and as of April 2018, one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 18, 2014"},{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Mar 15, 2022"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Grand Theft Auto V"}]},"Gran Turismo 7":{"Title":"Gran Turismo 7","Genre(s)":"Racing","Developer(s)":"Polyphony Digital","Publisher(s)":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","Description":"Gran Turismo 7 is a 2022 sim racing video game developed by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The story follows travel agent Manuel \"Manny\" Calavera as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \"Meche\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the Aztec afterlife with film noir style, with influences including The Maltese Falcon, On the Waterfront and Casablanca.\nGrim Fandango received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. However, it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre. The critical success of the 2012 video game, Telltale's The Walking Dead, was seen as constituting a revitalization of the adventure genre.\nIn 2014, with help from Sony, Schafer's studio Double Fine Productions acquired the Grim Fandango license following Disney's acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year.

The player commands units called familiars, each having strengths and weaknesses against the other, with the goal of either destroying the opponent's bases or surviving waves of enemies.\nGrimGrimoire was born from Vanillaware staff wanting to create their version of StarCraft, beginning development after completion of their first title Odin Sphere.

As with previous games in the series, the goal is to use a special guitar controller to match fret patterns displayed on a scrolling note pattern on screen in time with the music.\nThe game serves as a reboot of the Guitar Hero franchise, being the first new entry in the series since Warriors of Rock in 2010. Activision wanted to bring back Guitar Hero for the next generation of video game consoles but wanted the new game to be innovative. These innovations included a new guitar controller featuring a 6 button, 3-fret layout in contrast to the 5 button controller of previous games. The game featured two main modes; GH Live, the games career mode, featured the note pattern displayed atop full motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist during a concert, with the crowd and other band members dynamically reacting to the player's performance. In the other main mode, GHTV, songs are presented with the note track overlaid atop their music video or from live concert footage. The mode also allows players to pick up and play currently-streamed songs at any time or use money and in-game credits to play any song within the library, forgoing traditional downloadable content. The game was shipped with forty-two songs on disc and 200 songs within the GHTV library; New content has been added to GHTV on a weekly basis, provided through premium shows that earn players unique rewards.\nGuitar Hero Live was released to mostly positive reception, with critics praising the new controller design for providing trickier and more realistic gameplay in comparison to previous Guitar Hero games, as well as the wider variety of content available via the GHTV mode. The main Live portion of the game received mixed reviews, with critics panning its weak soundtrack, lack of multiplayer and the live action videos. The GHTV mode also received mixed reception for its reliance on microtransactions, and the inability to permanently purchase songs to own.\nDue to the game's underwhelming sales and reception, Activision laid off many employees of FreeStyleGames and sold the company to Ubisoft in 2017. The GHTV mode was shut down on 1 December 2018, reducing the available Guitar Hero songs from 484 to the 42 present on-disc.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Oct 20, 2015"}]},"Gundam Breaker 3":{"Title":"Gundam Breaker 3","Genre(s)":"Mech-combat","Developer(s)":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","Publisher(s)":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","Description":"The popularity of the Japanese anime metaseries Gundam since its release in 1979 has resulted in a spread of merchandise across various forms, with video games among them. \nThis is a list of video games that are set in the franchise's various timelines, and are segregated by the console systems they were released for.\nBy March 2004, the series had sold over 20 million units.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Unreleased"}]},"Gundam Versus":{"Title":"Gundam Versus","Genre(s)":"Mech-combat","Developer(s)":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","Publisher(s)":"Bandai Namco Entertainment","Description":"The popularity of the Japanese anime metaseries Gundam since its release in 1979 has resulted in a spread of merchandise across various forms, with video games among them. \nThis is a list of video games that are set in the franchise's various timelines, and are segregated by the console systems they were released for.\nBy March 2004, the series had sold over 20 million units.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Sep 29, 2017"}]},"Gungrave G.O.R.E.":{"Title":"Gungrave G.O.R.E.","Genre(s)":"Third-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Iggymob","Publisher(s)":"Iggymob","Description":"Gungrave (ガングレイヴ, Gangureivu) is a 2002 third-person shooter video game developed and published by Red Entertainment (Sega in North America and Activision in Europe) for the PlayStation 2.

The series contains three games: .hack//G.U. Vol. 1//Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2//Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3//Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called The World—the player controls a character who plays the fictional online game. They were directed by Hiroshi Matsuyama who aimed to address criticisms of the previous series. Its narrative, by Tatsuya Hamazaki, was written concurrently with .hack//Roots, an anime set before the events of the games.\nThe story focuses on a character named Haseo. He hunts another player named \"Tri-Edge\" who killed his friend Shino within the game and left her in a coma in real life. Haseo joins an organization that is also tracking Tri-Edge. The reason Shino and other players fall into comas is connected with AIDA, a mysterious computer anomaly that infects their characters. During the release of the games in Japan, Bee Train produced .hack//Roots, which depicts Haseo's first days in The World. The series has also been adapted into a manga, a light novel, and a CGI film.\nCritical reception to the games has been lukewarm with reviewers focusing on how the developers dealt with the issues regarding the previous .hack games and the execution of the storyline across the three titles. The first game got higher ratings; critics praised the addition of new gameplay features while parts from the story have been labeled as filler. Average scores declined across the three games. A high-definition remaster of the trilogy, .hack//G.U. Last Recode, was released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in November 2017, and was released on Nintendo Switch in March 2022. The remaster marks the first time that .hack//G.U. was released in Europe. The collection received more praise than the original trilogy for solving issues with the gameplay and presentation but was criticized for the lack of variety in dungeons.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 1, 2017"}]},"Hakoniwa Company Works":{"Title":"Hakoniwa Company Works","Genre(s)":["Role-playing","sandbox"],"Developer(s)":"Nippon Ichi Software","Publisher(s)":"Nippon Ichi Software","Description":"Hakoniwa Company Works (Japanese: ハコニワカンパニワークス, Hakoniwa Kanpani Wākusu) is a tactical role-playing game with elements of a sandbox game developed and published by Nippon Ichi Software.

To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with neuroscientists, mental health specialists, and people living with the condition.\nHellblade was a commercial success and was well-received by critics, who praised it as a work of art and applauded its uncommon choice of revolving around psychosis, the quality and uniqueness of its approach of the condition, and its story and main character.

The game, which has six episodes, is the sixth mainline entry in the Hitman franchise, the first installment of the World of Assassination trilogy, and the successor to Hitman: Absolution (2012). The single-player story follows genetically-engineered assassin Agent 47 as he goes on a worldwide adventure and solves a mysterious series of seemingly unconnected assassinations. Hitman features a number of large, open-ended sandboxes that Agent 47 can freely explore. The game presents the player with various assassination opportunities, many of which are unconventional. IO Interactive introduced a \"live component\" to the game with new content being regularly delivered in downloadable form.\nSquare Enix Europe set up a Montréal studio to work on the next Hitman game, but IO Interactive returned to lead the game's development following the under-performance of Absolution. The title was conceived as a re-imagining  of the franchise as the team attempted to integrate the gameplay of Absolution with the open-endedness of earlier installments of the series. According to the team, Hitman is a puzzle game with action and stealth elements; the developers refined the simulation and artificial intelligence of each level. The game adopted an episodic model and the team envisioned the game as a service. It was marketed as a \"World of Assassination\" and provided a platform that would expand and evolve over time, and inspire a trilogy of games.\nUpon its release, Hitman received positive reviews; critics praised the game's episodic release format, locations, level design, and its replayability but criticised the always-online requirement and excessive handholding. The game under-performed commercially and caused publisher Square Enix to divest from IO Interactive in May 2017. Following a management buyout, IO retained the rights to the series and partnered with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment to produce a sequel titled Hitman 2, which was released in November 2018. The World of Assassination trilogy was concluded with Hitman 3 in January 2021.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Mar 11, 2016"}]},"Hitman 2":{"Title":"Hitman 2","Genre(s)":"Stealth","Developer(s)":"IO Interactive","Publisher(s)":"WB Games","Description":"Hitman 2 is a 2018 stealth video game that was developed by IO Interactive and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It is the seventh major installment in the Hitman video game series, the sequel to 2016's Hitman and the second game in the World of Assassination trilogy. The game's story continues the plot arc started in Hitman and follows genetically engineered assassin Agent 47 as he searches for the mysterious \"Shadow Client\" and his allies, who are trying to destroy Providence, a secretive organization that controls the world's affairs. Like its predecessor, Hitman 2 features six large sandbox locations that players can freely explore to find opportunities to eliminate their targets. The game also included two online multiplayer modes called Sniper Assassin and Ghost Mode, whose internet servers were shut down in August 2020.\nSales of the 2016 episodic game Hitman fell short of expectations, prompting the series' publisher Square Enix to sell IO Interactive, which became an independent studio after a management buyout. With a limited cash flow, the studio laid off nearly half of its employees and had to reduce the scope of the sequel, whose development was about 25% completed. Because the framework had been created with the previous game, development of Hitman 2 was faster than usual, taking about twenty-one months. The first game's episodic model was abandoned and Hitman 2 was released in full. The studio supported the game with additional content, including two paid maps, and free elusive targets and contracts.\nHitman 2 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2018. Upon release, the game was met with generally positive reviews; critics considered it to be an improvement over its predecessor. The game's maps, sandbox design, gameplay enhancements, humour and assassination opportunities were praised, though the story and the multiplayer modes received a mixed response. Hitman 2 recuperated its developmental costs but its launch during a crowded release window negatively affected sales.

Concluding the plot arc started in Hitman, the single-player storyline follows genetically-engineered assassin Agent 47 and his allies as they hunt down the leaders of the secretive organization Providence, which controls the world's affairs and was partially responsible for 47's creation and upbringing.\nThe game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a focus on interactive elements in 47's environment. Like the previous entries in the series, the game features 6 levels, with 5 of them being large open-ended sandbox levels. Agent 47 can walk around each map freely to discover assassination opportunities. The player can complete challenges within each mission in order to unlock new items.\nHitman 3 was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Stadia (under the title Hitman: World of Assassination) and Nintendo Switch (via cloud gaming) on 20 January 2021.

It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using a specially designed fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanism is the game's key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are the same color as the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.\nDevelopment on Ikaruga began during director Hiroshi Iuchi's off-hours while Treasure was busy developing Sin and Punishment (2000).  The game began as a sequel to Radiant Silvergun, and borrows many elements from it as well as the polarity mechanism from Treasure's Silhouette Mirage (1997). During the game's prototype stages, the player's ammo was limited. The bullet absorption mechanism was used as a means to refill ammo, however, this was found to be weak as it created too many breaks in the action. In tradition with Treasure's game design philosophy, Ikaruga was intentionally crafted to challenge the conventions of standard game design and develop a new type of shooting game. All together, five Treasure staff worked on Ikaruga, as well as three support staff from G.rev.\nUpon its initial release in Japanese arcades, reception was mixed. Treasure staff explained this was due to players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, Ikaruga was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began to grow a cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics as well as the art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. Ikaruga was later ported to the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. In retrospect, Ikaruga is regarded by critics as one of the best shoot 'em ups of all time and one of Treasure's greatest works.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Jun 29, 2018"}]},"Ikenfell":{"Title":"Ikenfell","Genre(s)":"Tactical role-playing","Developer(s)":"Happy Ray Games","Publisher(s)":"Humble Games","Description":"Ikenfell is a role-playing video game developed by Happy Ray Games and published by Humble Games.

The game was initially released in May 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; a Microsoft Windows version was released later in November 2017. An expanded version of the game, titled Injustice 2: Legendary Edition, was released in March 2018 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. Similar to the previous installment, a companion mobile app was released for Android and iOS devices. A prequel comic book series of the same name, written by Tom Taylor, was also released beginning in April 2017.\nThe core gameplay remains similar to its predecessor, albeit with minor adjustments to returning game mechanics. Injustice 2 introduces a new feature called the Gear System, a loot-dropping system that rewards players with costume pieces and equipment that can be used to customize characters' appearances and modify their abilities and stats. According to developers, the idea for implementing a role playing game (RPG)-style progression system into a fighting game had existed since before the fall of Midway Games, the original publisher for the Mortal Kombat series. Director Ed Boon also sought to incorporate gameplay mechanics used by multiplayer shooter games, such as personalization, character creation, loot, and leveling up, into the fighting game genre, which led to the development of the Gear System.\nInjustice 2's storyline centers around Batman and his insurgency's attempt to restore society after the fall of Superman's Regime; however, the arrivals of the newly formed supervillain group \"The Society\" and the alien Brainiac force Batman to consider freeing the imprisoned Superman to help combat the threats. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, presentation, improved gameplay mechanics, abundance of in-game content, and character customization options, while criticizing its random loot and microtransaction systems.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"May 16, 2017"}]},"The Inpatient":{"Title":"The Inpatient","Genre(s)":"Interactive drama","Developer(s)":"Supermassive Games","Publisher(s)":"Sony Interacive Entertainment","Description":"The Inpatient is a psychological horror video game developed by Supermassive Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 and its virtual reality headset PlayStation VR.

The latter was released on handheld systems between 1999 and 2014 with versions for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. Although the series was originally designed as the side-story of Success mode and was part of the main series, Konami retroactively declared it as a separate series.\nOn May 12, 2006, a version of Power Pro was released featuring Major League Baseball players, under the title Jikkyō Powerful Major League. The Power Pro series has featured online play since its tenth incarnation on the PS2 and its first handheld version on the PlayStation Portable. A version of Power Pro was announced for the PlayStation 3, first shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2005, but it would take another five years for the series to reach the PS3, with the system instead getting Power Pro's sister series, Professional Baseball Spirits, for the interim. On August 3, 2007, an American release of the series was announced for both the PlayStation 2 and the Wii. The game, titled MLB Power Pros, was published by 2K Sports, and  features a Success Mode set within Major League Baseball.The most distinctive feature of the Power Pro series is its odd depiction of characters. The basic design of the Power Pro baseball player is a short figure with an excessively wide, gashapon capsule-shaped head, lacking a mouth, nose, ears with expression being mainly in the eyebrows. Power Pros characters are somewhat similar to the character Rayman, in that they do not have legs and thus their feet are not connected to their body. Power Pros characters do have arms and hands; however, their hands are fingerless and bear more resemblance to a sphere than a human hand. The Power Pro series has used this comic design for every single one of its games.\nIn Japan, the series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, while in North America it received mixed to generally favourable reviews and sold poorly. As of December 2020, the series has sold over 23.5 million copies, in addition to 44 million mobile game downloads as of October 2020.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Unreleased"}]},"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Baseball 2018":{"Title":"Jikkyou Powerful Pro Baseball 2018","Genre(s)":"Sports","Developer(s)":"Konami","Publisher(s)":"Konami","Description":"eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball, previously known as Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū and marketed internationally as Power Pros, is a Japanese baseball video game series created by Konami.

It is long running in Japan, starting out in 1994 for the Super Famicom, and appearing on many different consoles: the Sega Saturn (1995–1997), the PlayStation (1994–2003), the Nintendo 64 (1997–2001), the PlayStation 2 (2000–2009), the Dreamcast (2000), the Nintendo GameCube (2002–2006), Wii (2007–2009), PlayStation 3 (2010–2016), PlayStation 4 (since 2016) as well as the PlayStation Portable (2007–2013) and the PlayStation Vita (2012-2018).\nThe game also has two spin-off series, Professional Baseball Spirits, a baseball sports simulation series with more realistic graphics and physics, and Power Pro Kun Pocket. The latter was released on handheld systems between 1999 and 2014 with versions for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. Although the series was originally designed as the side-story of Success mode and was part of the main series, Konami retroactively declared it as a separate series.\nOn May 12, 2006, a version of Power Pro was released featuring Major League Baseball players, under the title Jikkyō Powerful Major League. The Power Pro series has featured online play since its tenth incarnation on the PS2 and its first handheld version on the PlayStation Portable. A version of Power Pro was announced for the PlayStation 3, first shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2005, but it would take another five years for the series to reach the PS3, with the system instead getting Power Pro's sister series, Professional Baseball Spirits, for the interim. On August 3, 2007, an American release of the series was announced for both the PlayStation 2 and the Wii. The game, titled MLB Power Pros, was published by 2K Sports, and  features a Success Mode set within Major League Baseball.The most distinctive feature of the Power Pro series is its odd depiction of characters. The basic design of the Power Pro baseball player is a short figure with an excessively wide, gashapon capsule-shaped head, lacking a mouth, nose, ears with expression being mainly in the eyebrows. Power Pros characters are somewhat similar to the character Rayman, in that they do not have legs and thus their feet are not connected to their body. Power Pros characters do have arms and hands; however, their hands are fingerless and bear more resemblance to a sphere than a human hand. The Power Pro series has used this comic design for every single one of its games.\nIn Japan, the series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, while in North America it received mixed to generally favourable reviews and sold poorly. As of December 2020, the series has sold over 23.5 million copies, in addition to 44 million mobile game downloads as of October 2020.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Unreleased"}]},"Jisei: The First Case HD":{"Title":"Jisei: The First Case HD","Genre(s)":"Visual novel","Developer(s)":"Sakevisual","Publisher(s)":"Ratalaika Games","Description":"The Jisei series is a visual novel series created by sakevisual for the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux platforms.

It was later ported to Microsoft Windows in June 2019 and iOS in August 2019.\nIn Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime, which transforms dull pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.\nReviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience, and have since listed it as one of the greatest video games of all time.

A remastered version of the game, with the subtitle Remastered in Japan and Asia, was released for the PlayStation 5, Stadia, and Xbox Series X and Series S in April 2021. Judgment follows lawyer-turned-detective Takayuki Yagami and his allies as they explore a case involving corpses whose eyes have been removed. The player controls Yagami in the fictional Tokyo district of Kamurocho, where he fights thugs and yakuza while carrying out missions involving chasing, stealth, and searching for clues.\nThe game began its initial development in 2015 under the codename Project Judge. The game originated from Sega's desire to create a new IP with Toshihiro Nagoshi serving as the writer. Nagoshi wanted to write a new type of story with a detective working on a case that contrasted with Nagoshi's previous work in Yakuza. As a result, the developers designed the game to be accessible to detective-game newcomers. Singer and actor Takuya Kimura, who provided both facial features and Japanese voice acting, was cast to play Yagami. Due to popular demand, the game includes an English voice-over dub as well as subtitles in several additional languages. The Japanese rock band Alexandros produced two songs for the game.\nJudgment was withdrawn from the Japanese market in March 2019 following the arrest of Pierre Taki, one of the game's actors, for suspected cocaine use. While localizing the game for international markets, Taki's  likeness was removed and his voice acting performance was replaced. Judgment received a generally positive response from critics. Many praised the game's plot and side content but criticized the simplicity of its investigation mechanics. Judgment was a commercial success, topping one million and earned recognition as one of the best video games released in 2019. The remaster was praised for improving the game's frame rate and visuals.

Its development began in 2016, after NBCUniversal approached Frontier Developments about creating a game to accompany the theatrical release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. To do this, Frontier staff inspected different dinosaur models and reference materials sent by Universal, watched the Jurassic Park films, and read the novels and fan theories. The team consulted paleontologist Jack Horner when they designed the dinosaurs. Jeff Goldblum, Bryce Dallas Howard and BD Wong reprised their roles from the Jurassic Park film series, voicing remarks to players and contributing to the game's narrative.\nAnnounced at Gamescom 2017, the game received a generally mixed critical reception. Critics praised its dinosaur designs and graphics, but the game's contracts, simulation and management gameplay were less well-received. The game's tutorial and learning curve were also criticized.

Designer Keita Takahashi struggled to pitch the game to Namco's superiors, eventually seeking student aid from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory to develop the project for less than US$ 1 million. As director, Takahashi emphasized concepts of novelty, ease of understanding and enjoyment.\nThe game's plot concerns a diminutive prince on a mission to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were inadvertently destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This is achieved by rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to human beings to mountains, until the ball has grown large enough to become a star. Katamari Damacy's story, settings and characters are highly stylized and surreal, often both celebrating and satirizing facets of Japanese culture.\nKatamari Damacy was well-received in Japan and North America, becoming a surprise hit and winning several awards. Its success led to the creation of the greater Katamari franchise, and inspired numerous subsequent games imitating its quirky, colorful charm. Some critics have hailed it as a cult classic and one of the greatest video games of all time, praising its gameplay, replay value, humor, originality, and shibuya-kei soundtrack. A high-definition remaster of the game, Katamari Damacy Reroll, was released on Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch in December 2018, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2020, and on Stadia in September 2021.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 20, 2020"}]},"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes":{"Title":"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes","Genre(s)":"Puzzle","Developer(s)":"Steel Crate Games","Publisher(s)":"Steel Crate Games","Description":"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a puzzle video game developed and published by Canadian studio Steel Crate Games.

Noire uses the proprietary motion capture technology MotionScan, which captures actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a realistic recreation of a human face essential for the game's interrogations. As part of their research for the open world, the development team conducted field research in Los Angeles. The game features an original score inspired by 1940s films, and contains licensed music of songs from the era. The game was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members, and Team Bondi closed shortly after the game's initial release.\nL.A. Noire was the first video game honoured as an official selection at the Tribeca Film Festival. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in May 2011, and for Microsoft Windows in November; an enhanced version was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in November 2017. The game received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at the facial animation, narrative, characters, performances, music, world design, and interrogation gameplay, though responses to the shooting and driving mechanics were mixed. It shipped four million units in its first month and 7.5 million by September 2017, and received multiple year-end nominations from gaming publications. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of cases playable in virtual reality, was released in December 2017.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Nov 14, 2017"}]},"La-Mulana":{"Title":"La-Mulana","Genre(s)":"Platform-adventure","Developer(s)":["GR3 Project","Nigoro"],"Publisher(s)":["JP: Playism","WW: NIS America"],"Description":"La-Mulana (stylized as La•Mʊlana) is a platform-adventure video game, designed to imitate the look and feel of MSX games.

Limbo is a 2D side-scroller, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character. The player guides an unnamed boy through dangerous environments and traps as he searches for his sister. The developer built the game's puzzles expecting the player to fail before finding the correct solution. Playdead called the style of play \"trial and death\", and used gruesome imagery for the boy's deaths to steer the player from unworkable solutions.\nThe game is presented in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo as an example of video games as an art form. Limbo received critical acclaim, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found the open-ended work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length. The game has been listed among the greatest games of all time.\nLimbo was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. It won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named as one of the top games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in Limbo.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Feb 24, 2015"}]},"The Little Acre":{"Title":"The Little Acre","Genre(s)":"Graphic adventure","Developer(s)":"Pewter Games","Publisher(s)":"Curve Digital","Description":"The Little Acre is an adventure game developed by Pewter Games Studios with Charles Cecil and published by Curve Digital. \nIt was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Steam on December 13, 2016.

It was published for PlayStation Portable (PSP) by Bandai in Japan and by Ubisoft internationally. The objective of the game is to rotate and drop 2×2 groups of blocks in order to create single-color 2×2 squares. A vertical line known as the \"time line\" sweeps across the field, erases completed squares, and awards points. Each stage has a skin that affects the background, block colors, music, and speed of the time line.\nLumines is the work of video game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who had previously worked at Sega. Katsumi Yokota contributed as the graphic designer and assisted Takayuki Nakamura in music composition. Originally, Mizuguchi wanted to make a music-heavy Tetris game, but licensing issues prevented this, leading him to create a new concept for Lumines. Mizuguchi was inspired to make a music game on the PSP, one of the few handhelds on the market with a headphone jack. It was released as a launch title for PSP in Japan in December 2004, in North America in March 2005, and in Europe in September 2005. It was followed by ports for mobile phones, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 2 (PS2); and a high-definition remaster for PlayStation 4 (PS4), Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Windows.\nThe game earned critical acclaim and commercial success, selling over half a million copies between North America, Europe, and Japan, and earning \"Best Handheld Game of 2005\". It was recognized as one of the best-ever launch titles by multiple media outlets. It was praised for its music and gameplay, with multiple reviewers describing it as addictive and comparing it to Tetris. The ports received less praise than the original. The mobile phone version was commended by critics for its new features, but criticized for its poor sound quality, while the PS2 port was criticized for removing content from the original. Reviewers complimented the remastered version for enhancing the quality of sounds and visuals, yet were also disappointed with the lack of an online multiplayer mode. The game led to numerous spin-offs and sequels for multiple platforms, becoming the first entry in the Lumines series.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 4","Release date":"Jun 26, 2018"}]},"Lumo":{"Title":"Lumo","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure","Developer(s)":"Triple Eh?","Publisher(s)":"Rising Star Games","Description":"Lumo is a 3D isometric puzzle platform game developed by Triple Eh?

The game has two gameplay modes. In \"Battle Royale\", up to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In \"Arenas\", players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.\nApex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series, with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as minor characters or playable Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a secret right up until its launch.

Its main story focuses on the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.\nSkyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, which was rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise for its character advancement, world design, visuals, and dual-wielding combat, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Criticism targeted the melee combat, the dragon battles, and the numerous technical issues present at launch.

Directed and produced by Naoki Yoshida, it was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 in August 2013, as a replacement for the failed 2010 version of the game, with support for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and macOS releasing later. Final Fantasy XIV takes place in the fictional land of Eorzea, five years after the events of the original 2010 release. At the conclusion of the original game, the primal dragon Bahamut escapes from its lunar prison to initiate the Seventh Umbral Calamity, an apocalyptic event which destroys much of Eorzea. Through the gods' blessing, the player character escapes the devastation by time traveling five years into the future. As Eorzea recovers and rebuilds, the player must deal with the impending threat of invasion by the Garlean Empire from the north.\nThe original Final Fantasy XIV, released in September 2010, was a commercial and critical failure. In response, then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would take over and attempt to fix the issues with it. This team was responsible for generating content for the original version as well as developing a brand new game which would address all of the previous release's criticisms. This new game, initially dubbed \"Version 2.0\", features a new game engine, improved server infrastructure, and revamped gameplay, interface, and story. The original version shut down in November 2012 and was followed by an alpha test for Version 2.0.\nThe game released to largely positive reception; critics praised the game for its solid mechanics and progression, and they commended Yoshida for turning the project around. After a poor 2013 fiscal year, Square Enix executives attributed the company's 2014 return to profitability in part to the game's strong sales and subscriber base, reaching a total of over 24 million registered players by October 2021, also becoming the most profitable Final Fantasy game to date.

The game is the online component of Grand Theft Auto V. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on Southern California), Grand Theft Auto Online allows up to 32 players to explore its open world environment and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches.\nThe open-world design lets players freely roam San Andreas, which includes an open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). Players control a customisable silent protagonist in their journey to become a powerful criminal, slowly building an empire as they complete increasingly difficult tasks.

At launch, it suffered widespread technical issues resulting in the inability to play missions and loss of character data. It initially polarised reviewers, being criticised for its lack of direction and repetitive missions, with praise particularly directed at the scope and open-ended gameplay.

Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term \"grand theft auto\", used in the United States for motor vehicle theft.\nGameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco), and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting; usually one of the original three locales, albeit remodelled and significantly expanded. The series centers on different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each title. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or their organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, as it brought the series to a three-dimensional (3D) setting and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and received significant acclaim. They have influenced other open-world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.\nThe series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest and best selling video games; it has shipped more than 370 million units, making it the fifth-best selling video game franchise. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports. The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"2022"}]},"Guardians of the Galaxy":{"Title":"Guardians of the Galaxy","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure","Developer(s)":"Eidos-Montréal","Publisher(s)":"Square Enix","Description":"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a 2021 action-adventure game developed by Eidos-Montréal and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary.

While Zagreus will often die, the player can use gained treasure to improve certain attributes or unlock new weapons and abilities to improve chances of escaping on subsequent runs.\nHades was developed following Supergiant's Pyre, a game in which they wanted to explore procedural narrative storytelling, but due to the nature of the main gameplay, found that players did not play through Pyre multiple times to explore this. The roguelike structure of Hades gave them the opportunity to tell these branching stories to the player over the course of multiple runs.\nA commercial and critical success, Hades received universal acclaim for its gameplay, art direction, music, narrative and characters and sold over one million copies. It is considered to be one of the best video games of 2020, and was named game of the year from several award ceremonies and media publications.\n\n","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Aug 13, 2021"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Hades"}]},"Hell Let Loose":{"Title":"Hell Let Loose","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Black Matter","Publisher(s)":"Team17","Description":"Hell Let Loose is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video game developed by Australian studio Black Matter and published by Team17.

Adams pursues the sorcerer Edward Kelley into the final battles of the Sengoku period during Tokugawa Ieyasu's efforts to unify Japan, an effort complicated by the emergence of yōkai that are flourishing in the chaos of war. Gameplay revolves around navigating levels and defeating monsters that have infested an area; combat revolves around stamina or \"Ki\" management and different sword stances that are strong or weak against different enemies.\nNioh began development in 2004 for the PlayStation 3 as part of a multimedia project based on an unfinished Akira Kurosawa script. The project went through a turbulent and prolonged pre-production period, going through multiple revisions until its final version began development in 2014 for the PS4. The story was based on the life of Western samurai William Adams, though it was embellished with supernatural elements. Development information was sporadic until 2015, when it was reintroduced to the public.\nAlpha and beta demos were released during 2016, to both gauge public reaction to the title and make adjustments based on feedback. Initially scheduled for a 2016 release, the adjustments pushed the release into the following year.

It was released worldwide for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in August 2016, for Xbox One in July 2018, and for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S consoles in November 2020. A Nintendo Switch port is scheduled for release in mid-2022, while ports for macOS and iPadOS are in development. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a procedurally generated deterministic open world universe, which includes over 18 quintillion planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of flora and fauna, and various alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, building planetary bases and expanding space fleets, or otherwise following the game's overarching plot by seeking out the mystery around the entity known as The Atlas.\nSean Murray, the founder of Hello Games, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game was seen as an ambitious project for a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\nNo Man's Sky received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lackluster and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly multiplayer capabilities. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its players. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to the game until they are nearly ready to ship. The promotion and marketing for No Man's Sky became a subject of debate and has been cited as an example of what to avoid in video game marketing.\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand No Man's Sky to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build. The game has received multiple free major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, cross-platform play, and virtual reality support, all of which have substantially improved its overall reception, and considered to have redeemed both the game and Hello Games from the troublesome launch.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Nov 12, 2020"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"No Man's Sky"}]},"No More Heroes III":{"Title":"No More Heroes III","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure","Developer(s)":"Grasshopper Manufacture","Publisher(s)":"Marvelous","Description":"No More Heroes III is a 2021 action-adventure hack-and-slash video game developed and published by Grasshopper Manufacture in collaboration with Marvelous. It is the fourth installment in the No More Heroes series and is the third mainline entry in the series. After an eleven-year hiatus since No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, the game stars professional assassin Travis Touchdown and follows his return to the fictional city of Santa Destroy, as he must defend the world from a powerful army of alien invaders led by the galactic overlord prince FU and his nine soldiers who adopt the façade of galactic superheroes.Development of the game began around the completion of the spinoff title Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes in early 2019, which served as a prequel. The series' creator and director Goichi Suda had received many fan requests to make a third entry in the series after the release of the second game, but development on a new entry would be postponed for many years due to Grasshopper Manufacture working on other projects such as Lollipop Chainsaw and Let It Die.

It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015; the game was also released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S exactly five years later on December 1, 2020. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, \"situations\" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the \"White Masks\", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.\nSiege is an entry in the Rainbow Six series and the successor to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. After Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, Ubisoft decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units and looked at real-life examples of sieges such as the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.\nThe game received an overall positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \"games as a service\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free downloadable content. Several years after the game's release, some critics regarded Siege as one of the best multiplayer games in the modern market due to the improvements brought by the post-launch updates. The company partnered with ESL to make Siege an esports game. In December 2020, the game surpassed 70 million registered players across all platforms. Rainbow Six Extraction, a spin-off game featuring Siege characters, was released in January 2022.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Dec 1, 2020"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege"}]},"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2":{"Title":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2","Genre(s)":"Sports","Developer(s)":"Vicarious Visions","Publisher(s)":"Activision","Description":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 is a skateboarding video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Activision.

It is the third instalment in the Watch Dogs series and the sequel to 2016's Watch Dogs 2. Set within a fictionalised representation of a futuristic, dystopian London, the game's story follows the hacker syndicate DedSec as they seek to clear their names after being framed for a series of terrorist bombings. DedSec also attempt to liberate London's citizens from the control of Albion, an oppressive private military company which turned the city into a surveillance state following the bombings.\nWhile the core gameplay is similar to its predecessors, consisting of a combination of shooting, driving, stealth, and hacking puzzles, Legion introduces a multiple playable characters system, allowing players to recruit virtually any NPC found in the game's open world. Each playable character has their own unique skills and backgrounds, and can be lost permanently if players enable the option of permadeath before starting a new game. There are multiple ways to complete missions depending on which playable character is selected. In March 2021, a cooperative multiplayer mode was added to the game, allowing up to four players to complete missions or explore London together.\nLegion was released on 29 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Stadia, and as a launch title in November for the Xbox Series X/S, the PlayStation 5, and Amazon Luna. Upon release, the game received mixed to positive reviews. Critics were polarized over the multiple playable characters aspect, with some appreciating its diversity and the inclusion of permadeath for allowing emotional attachment from players, while others criticized the characters' lack of personality and the imbalance between their abilities. Criticism was also aimed at the game's world, driving mechanics, inconsistent difficulty, repetitive missions, online features and technical problems. \nUbisoft supported Legion extensively after its launch, releasing a number of updates for both the single-player and multiplayer modes that added new missions, game modes, and playable characters; a crossover event with the Assassin's Creed franchise; and a paid story expansion, Watch Dogs: Legion - Bloodline, which continues the storylines of Aiden Pearce, the protagonist of the first Watch Dogs game, and Wrench, a major supporting character from Watch Dogs 2.

Support for cross-platform play and cross-save, as well as ports to mobile devices, are planned for 2022. The game is in a long-term state of open beta.\nIn Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of suspended animation far into Earth's future to find themselves at war in the planetary system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a variety of weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level design. The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno with improved gear. The game includes both player versus environment and player versus player elements. It is supported by microtransactions, which lets players purchase in-game items using real money, but also offers the option to earn them at no cost through grinding.\nThe concept for Warframe originated in 2000, when Digital Extremes began work on a new game titled Dark Sector. At the time, the company had been successful in supporting other developers and publishers, and wanted to develop their own game in-house. Dark Sector suffered several delays and was eventually released in 2008, having used some of the initial framework but far different from the original plan. By 2012, in the wake of the success of free-to-play games, the developers took their earlier Dark Sector ideas and art assets and incorporated them into a new project, their self-published Warframe.\nInitially, the growth of Warframe was slow, hindered by moderate critical reviews and low player counts. Since its release, the game has experienced positive growth. The game is one of Digital Extremes' most successful titles, seeing nearly 50 million registered players by 2019.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Playstation 5","Release date":"Nov 26, 2020"},{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Warframe"}]},"Warhammer: Chaosbane":{"Title":"Warhammer: Chaosbane","Genre(s)":["Action role-playing","hack and slash"],"Developer(s)":"Eko Software","Publisher(s)":"Bigben Interactive","Description":"Warhammer: Chaosbane is an action role-playing game developed by Eko Software and published by Bigben Interactive.

Its most popular games include the Battletoads, Donkey Kong, and Banjo-Kazooie series, as well as games like GoldenEye 007 (1997), Perfect Dark (2000), and Sea of Thieves (2018).\nTim and Chris Stamper, who also founded Ultimate Play the Game, established Rare in 1985. During its early years, Rare was backed by an unlimited budget from Nintendo, primarily concentrated on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games. During this time, Rare created successful games such as Wizards & Warriors (1987), R.C. Pro-Am (1988), and Battletoads (1991). Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, which came to own a large minority stake of the company, with the release of Donkey Kong Country (1994). Throughout the 1990s, Rare started selling their games under the trademark name \"Rareware\" and received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as the Donkey Kong series, Killer Instinct (1994), GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie (1998), Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day (2001).\nIn 2002, Microsoft acquired Rare, which retained its original brand, logo, and most intellectual properties. Rare has since focused on developing games exclusively for Microsoft's video game consoles, including Grabbed by the Ghoulies (2003), Kameo (2005), Perfect Dark Zero (2005), and Viva Piñata (2006). In 2007, the Stampers left Rare to pursue other opportunities and, in 2010, the company's focus shifted to the Xbox Live Avatar and Kinect, releasing three Kinect Sports games. In 2015, Rare developed Rare Replay, an Xbox One-exclusive compilation containing 30 of its games to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Rare's most recent game, Sea of Thieves, was released in 2018.\nSeveral former Rare employees have formed their own companies, such as Free Radical Design, best known for producing the TimeSplitters series, and Playtonic Games, best known for Yooka-Laylee (2017). Rare is widely acknowledged by the gaming industry and has received numerous accolades from critics and journalists. It is known as secretive and seclusive. Several Rare games, such as Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye 007, have been cited as among the greatest and most influential games of all time, though some fans and former employees have been critical of the company's output since the Microsoft buyout.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Everwild"}]},"Fable":{"Title":"Fable","Genre(s)":"Action role-playing","Developer(s)":"Playground Games","Publisher(s)":"Xbox Game Studios","Description":"Fable is a series of action role-playing video games for Xbox, Microsoft Windows, macOS, Xbox 360 and Xbox One platforms.

The game was announced at The Game Awards 2015 ceremony, and released on August 25, 2021 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, and on May 24, 2022 for Linux and macOS.\nLike the game's predecessor, the player controls Raz, a young acrobat that is training to become a Psychonaut, a member of an international task force that uses their psychic abilities to stop those that perform nefarious deeds with their own psychic forces. Within Psychonauts 2, which follows directly from events of the interstitial virtual reality game, Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin, the Psychonauts try to learn who was really behind the kidnapping of their leader, unveiling a deep mystery surrounding the organization's founding and Raz's family history. To uncover the mystery, Raz enters the mindscapes of various characters to discover clues. Within these mindscapes, Raz can perform a variety of new and returning psychic abilities that allow him to maneuver through the often-twisted minds and battle the mental creatures they produce.\nThe original Psychonauts, released in 2005, was met with critical praise, but failed to sell well and was considered a commercial failure for several years after its first release. Double Fine and game director Tim Schafer had expressed the desire to create a sequel to Psychonauts, but the financial demand of developing the game stalled any serious attempt for several years. Double Fine regained the intellectual property to Psychonauts from Majesco Entertainment in 2011, allowing them to rerelease the game on modern platforms, which saw strong sales and increased demand from players for a sequel. Double Fine sought to acquire part of its financial capital to fund the developments of Psychonauts 2 through a US$3.3 million crowd-funding and investment drive through Fig, launched simultaneously with the game's announcement. The campaign raised nearly $4 million by the beginning of 2016. While Psychonauts 2 was initially to be published by Starbreeze Studios under a publishing-only deal, Starbreeze fell into bankruptcy in 2018.

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies. The multiplayer game sees players explore an open world via a pirate ship from a first-person perspective. Groups of players encounter each other regularly during their adventures, sometimes forming alliances, sometimes going head-to-head. \nSea of Thieves was conceived in 2014. Rare was inspired by players of PC games such as Eve Online (2003), DayZ (2018), and Rust (2018) who used the game tools to create their own stories. Rare explored different settings, such as vampires and dinosaurs, before settling on a pirate theme inspired by the Pirates of the Caribbean films and The Goonies (1985). The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Rare departed from its reputation for secrecy during Sea of Thieves's development, inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\nMicrosoft Studios released Sea of Thieves in March 2018 for Windows and Xbox One; it was one of the earliest first-party games released for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. Sea of Thieves received mixed reviews; critics praised the ship combat, multiplayer, visuals, and physics, but criticized the progression, gameplay, and lack of content. Rare envisioned Sea of Thieves as a \"game as a service\" and released numerous content updates after the initial release, which improved its overall reception. Sea of Thieves was a commercial success and became Microsoft's most successful original intellectual property of the eighth generation, attracting more than 30 million players by June 2022. An enhanced version of the game was released for the Xbox Series X/S in November 2020.\n\n","variants":[{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Sea of Thieves"}]},"Second Extinction":{"Title":"Second Extinction","Genre(s)":"First-person shooter","Developer(s)":"Systemic Reaction","Publisher(s)":"Avalanche Studios Group","Description":"Second Extinction is an upcoming cooperative first-person shooter, developed and published by Systemic Reaction for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S.

Set in a dark fantasy world inspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture, the game follows Senua, a Pict warrior who must make her way to Helheim by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess Hela. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in August 2017, Xbox One in April 2018, Nintendo Switch in April 2019, and Xbox Series X and Series S in August 2021. Hellblade features support for virtual reality, which was added in a 2018 update.\nSelf-described as an \"independent AAA game\", Hellblade was created by a team of approximately twenty developers led by writer and director Tameem Antoniades. The game blends different gameplay mechanics and concepts like puzzle solving, psychological horror and melee combat. Voice acting is an integral part of the game, while its cutscenes combine motion capture by Melina Juergens, and live action performances by other actors. The game's narrative serves as a metaphor for the character's struggle with psychosis, as Senua, who suffers from the condition but believes it to be a curse, is haunted by an entity known as the \"Darkness\", voices in her head known as \"Furies\", and memories from her past. To properly represent psychosis, developers worked closely with neuroscientists, mental health specialists, and people living with the condition.\nHellblade was a commercial success and was well-received by critics, who praised it as a work of art and applauded its uncommon choice of revolving around psychosis, the quality and uniqueness of its approach of the condition, and its story and main character. Its overall presentation, along with Juergens' performance, was also considered superior in quality to what independent games usually provide, although its gameplay and other elements received some criticism. The game sold over a million copies across all platforms by June 2018. A sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, was announced at The Game Awards 2019.","variants":[{"consoleName":"Xbox series X and series S","Release date":"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II"}]},"The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf":{"Title":"The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf","Genre(s)":"Action-adventure","Developer(s)":"OSome Studio","Publisher(s)":"Microids","Description":"The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf (French: Les Schtroumpfs: Mission Malfeuille) is a platform video game developed by OSome Studio and published by Microids, released on October 26, 2021.
